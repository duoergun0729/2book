re : investment cooperation .
i write to introduce some business venture to you , after i have gotten
your contact information on an international business directory . i
believe the venture in mind would be profitable to you if the necessary
understanding is achieved between us .
i am a business development specialist , and i represent some investors ,
who want to go into the business of purchasing materials in your
country , for further export in asia . materials to be purchased would
range from medical products , through textile and constructions equipments ,
and possible real estate investments would be considered . we therefore
would need a partner in your region who would guide us through the
necessary markets , and partner with us in the establishment of such
venture .
i would on this basis like to know if you would be interested in a
partnership with us , under the following terms :
1 . the start - up capital amounts to twenty five million american
dollars .
2 . the start - up amount is in cash and must be transferred in this same
state .
3 . you shall be paid a commission of ten percent of the start - up amount
as soon as we are able to establish a proper partnership and
relationship with you .
4 . the investors require for their personality and the investment to be
handled professionally and confidentially .
my request thus is for you to cooperate with me in the establishment of
a corporation in your country , through which the venture would be
established .
let me know if you would be able to cooperate with me in this manner .
i anticipate your response .
yours sincerely .
