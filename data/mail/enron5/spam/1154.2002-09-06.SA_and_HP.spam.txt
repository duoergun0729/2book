i am the chairman contract review committee of national
electric power authority ( nepa ) .
although this
proposal might come to you as a surprise since it is
coming from someone you do not know

decided to contact you based on
intuition .
we are soliciting for your humble and confidential
assistance to take custody of seventy -
one million ,
five hundred thousand united states
dollars . { us $ 71 , 500 , 000 . 00 } . this sum
( us $ 71 . 5 m ) is an over
invoice contract sum which is currently in an offshore
payment account of the central bank
of nigeria as an
unclaimed contract entitlement which can easily be
withdrawn or drafted or pay to any
recommended
beneficiary by my committee .
on this note , you will be presented as a contractor to
nepa who has executed a contract
to a tune of the
above sum and has not been paid .
proposed sharing partern ( % ) :
1 . 70 % for me and my colleagues .
2 . 20 % for you as a partner / fronting for us .
3 . 10 % for expenses that may be incurred by both parties
during the cause of this
