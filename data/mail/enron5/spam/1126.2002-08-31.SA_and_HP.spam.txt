first read about how a 15 year old made $ 71 , 000 . see below . . . .
as seen on national tv : this is the media report .
parents of 15 - year old - find $ 71 , 000 cash hidden
in his closet !
does this headline look familiar ? of course it does .
you most likely have just seen this story recently
featured on a major nightly news program ( usa ) .
and reported elsewhere in the world ( including my neck
of the woods - new zealand ) . his mother was cleaning
and putting laundry away when she came across a large
brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath
some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her
15 - year - old sons closet .
nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got
when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash .
five - dollar bills , twenties , fifties and hundreds -
all neatly rubber - banded in labeled piles .
" my first thought was that he had robbed a bank " ,
says the 41 - year - old woman , " there was over $ 71 , 000
dollars in that bag - - that ' s more than my husband
earns in a year " .
the woman immediately called her husband at the
car - dealership where he worked to tell him what she
had discovered . he came home right away and they
drove together to the boys school and picked him up .
little did they suspect that where the money came from
was more shocking than actually finding it in
the closet .
as it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via
e - mail , a type of " report " to e - mail addresses that he
obtained off the internet . everyday after school for
the past 2 months , he had been doing this right on his
computer in his bedroom .
" i just got the e - mail one day and i figured what the
heck , i put my name on it like the instructions said
and i started sending it out " , says the clever
15 - year - old .
the e - mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained
instructions to send one $ 5 dollar bill to each person
on the list , then delete the address at the top and
move the others addresses down , and finally to add
your name to the top of the list .
the letter goes on to state that you would receive
several thousand dollars in five - dollar bills within 2
weeks if you sent out the letter with your
name at the top of the 5 - address list . " i get junk
e - mail all the time , and really did not think it was
going to work " , the boy continues .
within the first few days of sending out the e - mail ,
the post office box that his parents had gotten him
for his video - game magazine subscriptions began to
fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing
$ 5 bills .
" about a week later i rode [ my bike ] down to the post
office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300
envelops stuffed in it . there was also a yellow slip
that said i had to go up to the [ post office ] counter .
i thought i was in trouble or something ( laughs ) " . he
goes on , " i went up to the counter and they had a
whole box of more mail for me . i had to ride back
home and empty out my backpack because i could not
carry it all " .
over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending
out the e - mail . " the money just kept coming in and i
just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet ,
barely had time for my homework " . he had also
been riding his bike to several of the banks in his
area and exchanging the $ 5 bills for twenties , fifties
and hundreds .
" i didn ' t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept
riding to different banks with like five thousand at a
time in my backpack . i would usually tell the lady at
the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to
exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me .
one time the lady gave me a really strange look and
told me that she would not be able to do it for me and
my dad would have to come in and do it , but i just
rode to the next bank down the street ( laughs ) . "
surprisingly , the boy did not have any reason to be
afraid . the reporting news team examined and
investigated the so - called " chain - letter " the boy was
sending out and found that it was not a chain - letter
at all . in fact , it was completely legal according to
us postal and lottery laws , title 18 , section 1302 and
1341 , or title 18 , section 3005 in the us code , also
in the code of federal regulations , volume 16 ,
sections 255 and 436 , which state a product or service
must be exchanged for money received .
every five - dollar bill that he received contained a
little note that read , " please send me report number
xyx " . this simple note made the letter legal because he
was exchanging a service ( a report on how - to ) for a
five - dollar fee .
[ this is the end of the media release . if you would
like to understand how the system works and get your
$ 71 , 000 - please continue reading . what appears below
is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -

home ! !

letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . due to the
popularity of this letter on the internet , a national weekly news
program
recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program

also
investigated whether or not the program was legal .
their findings proved once and for all that there are ' ' absolutely no
laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can - follow
the simple instructions , they are bound to make some mega bucks with only
$ 25 out of pocket cost ' ' .

i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it . i am so
glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for
the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received
total
$ 610 , 470 . 00 in 21 weeks , with money still coming in ' ' .

you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you
purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which
includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where to find thousands of
free
classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going :
method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally
= = = = = = =
let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and
we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each .
let ' s also assume that the mailing receive only a 0 . 2 % response ( the
response
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0 . 2 % . also many
people will send out hundreds of thousands e - mails instead of only 5 , 000
each ) . continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails .
with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1
those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total
of 50 , 000 .
out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with orders . that ' s = 100
people responded and ordered report # 2 .
those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000
e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 .
those 1000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 5
million e - mails sent out . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders
for report ! # 4 . whose 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a
total of
50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000
orders for
report # 5 that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half
million ) .
your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500
+ 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . . $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . . . . . . grand
total = $ 555 , 550 . 00
numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the
worst possibleresponses and no matter how you
calculate it , you will still
make a lot of money !
= = = = = = =
remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering
out
of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if
everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails
each or more ? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide
and counting . believe me , many people will do just that , and more !
method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet
= = = = = = =
advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are
hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the
internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you
start with method # land add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you
receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s
it . always provide
same day service on all orders .
this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your
name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise
until they receive the report .
