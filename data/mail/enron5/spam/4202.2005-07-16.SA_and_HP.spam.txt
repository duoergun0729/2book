employs some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our
anti - fraud teams regularly screen the paypal system for unusual

foreign country . if you accessed your account while traveling , the
attempt ( s ) may have been initiated by you .
because the behavior was unusual for your account , we would like to take
an extra step to ensure your security and you will now be taken through
