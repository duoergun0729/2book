technology .

and
governments to wirelessly track their assets and resources . such
technoiogy
has huge potential in the protection and transportation of materiais

and
equipment to detect possible probiems before they become serious , they
can
aiso deliver safety features within oi | wells . oil maybe trapped in
different | ayers of rock , aiong with gas and water . detection of
specific
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur ,

the
safe transit of materials by only the authorized handier , and | imit the
