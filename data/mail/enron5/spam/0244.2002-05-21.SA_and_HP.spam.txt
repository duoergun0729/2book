the crisis has ended and i need a trustworthy person
like you to
proceed to
the place of the security company in order to clear
the fund and
invest on
my behalf as i dont want my name to be used for now .
note that i will send to you the relevant documents
that will
enable
you take possesion of the the fund for onward
investment for our
mutual
benefit . all i need from you is as follows :
1 . a letter of committment ( duely signed ) that you
will keep the
transaction strictly confidential .
2 . your confirmation of your ability to handle this .
3 . your international identity or driving licence
number for
identification
to the security company .
