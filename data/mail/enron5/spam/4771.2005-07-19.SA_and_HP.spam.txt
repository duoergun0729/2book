did debbie love jumping in front of the restaurant ? .
toren came to me at age 32 months . he had 2 words : ma ma and bye bye . he could not focus , but ran around the room . his mother was convinced i was going to have him cured by his third birthday . i told her i was no miracle worker , but we ' d do what we could during the next 4 months . immediately we started structuring toren ' s day . i went home and worked up a program called ' toren ' s nouns ' . the first day i showed toren the program , he looked at it for 10 - 15 seconds and then left the computer . the next day he stayed about 30 seconds . each day he built up more time at the computer . by the second week , he would sit on my lap for 10 minutes pressing whichever word he wanted to hear . but he spoke no sounds , no words . three weeks passed . i began berating myself . ' see , jo , you thought this noun program was so great . look at toren , he ' s not learning anything . ' the fourth week toren walked over to the computer , picked up the overlay from the intellikeys keyboard , pointed to 10 different words and approximated each word . that day , i cried . .
thanks ,
