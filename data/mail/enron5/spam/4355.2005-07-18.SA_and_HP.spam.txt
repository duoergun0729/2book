donia lilly
artist statement
the physical world and its immediate appearances
have never held my fascination . although i draw inspiration
from what i see around me , it is my response to my environment
and experiences that is important to my artistic process .
reproducing recognizable subject matter does not interest
me as a final product . i am constantly borrowing lines , shapes ,
textures , and colors from nature , but use them for my own
creative purposes in my paintings and drawings . whether from
memory or imagination , my paintings are meant to create an
emotional sense of place , engulfing the viewer with calm and
unconventional beauty .

rebecca norton
flight of the contender ( fall
of the conqueror ) ( oil acrylic on canvas )
about the artist
in any sense , it is the repitition of situations
and their relative circumstances that give rise to what one
perceives . i strive to capture this through patterns and symbols
that promote the engagement of visual symbols and their development
towards abstract ideas .
