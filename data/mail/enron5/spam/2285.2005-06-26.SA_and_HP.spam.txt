education has been theirs in so much higher a degree ; the pen has
n at the back , beyon d the yard where th
spring was slow in unfolding . for the last few weeks of lent it had been
steadily fine and frosty weather . in the daytime there was a thaw in the
sun , but at night there were as many as seven degrees of frost . the snow was
so packed and frozen that loads could be carried along anywhere , regardless
of roads . easter came in snow . then all of a sudden , on easter monday , a
warm wind sprang up , storm clouds swooped down , and for three days and three
nights the warm , tempestuous rain fell in torrents . on thursday the wind
dropped , and a thick gray fog brooded over the land , as though screening the
mysteries of the transformations that were being wrought in nature . behind
the fog there was the flowing of water , the cracking and floating of ice ,
the swift rush of turbid , foaming torrents ; and on the following monday , in
the evening , the fog parted , the storm clouds split up into little curling
crests of cloud , the sky cleared , and the real spring had come . in the
morning the sun arose brilliant and quickly wore away the thin layer of ice
that covered the water , and all the warm air was quivering with the steam
that rose up from the quickened earth . the old grass looked greener , and the
young grass thrust up its tiny blades ; the buds of the guelder - rose and of
the currant , and the sticky birch buds were swollen with sap , and an
exploring bee was humming about the golden blossoms that studded the willow .
larks trilled unseen above the velvety green fields and the ice - covered
stubble land ; pewits wailed over the lowlands and marshes , flooded by the
pools ; cranes and wild geese flew high across the sky uttering their spring
calls . the cattle , bald in patches where the new hair had not grown yet ,
lowed in the pastures ; bowlegged lambs frisked round their bleating dams ,
who were shedding their fleece ; nimble - footed children ran along the drying
paths , covered with the prints of bare feet ; there was a merry chatter of
peasant women over their linen at the pond , and the ring of axes in the
yard , where the peasants were repairing plows and harrows . the real spring
had come . as she loves the admiral , i would always be with him , nothing
should ever
