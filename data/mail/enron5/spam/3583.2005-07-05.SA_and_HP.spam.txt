Subject: update your ebay account
your credit / debit card information must be updated
dear ebay member ,
we recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your ebay account from a
foreign ip address and we have reasons to believe that your account was used by
a third party without your authorization . if you recently accessed your account
while traveling , the unusual login attempts may have been initiated by you
the login attempt was made from :
ip address : 172 . 183 . 45 . 144
isp host : acb 72 d 90 . ipt . aol . com
by now , we used many techniques to verify the accuracy of the information our
users provide us when they register on the site . however , because user
verification on the internet is difficult , ebay cannot and does not confirm each
user ' s purported identity . thus , we have established an offline verification
system o help you evaluate with who you are dealing with .
click on the link below , fill the form and then submit as we will verify
