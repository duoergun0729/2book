roxxy ' s management team combines highly experienced industry executives
drawn from the major labels and also includes a staff of in - house
producers who are among the most influential talents in the music industry
today .
" it is roxxy ' s vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major
labels ' lack of commitment to their artists and customers ; labels that
cast aside established artists who can no longer generate multi - million
selling recordings , but who consistently release albums which sell
hundreds of thousands of records to a large and loyal fan base ; artists
that can easily generate revenues between $ 1 and $ 5 million per title , "

to distribute our own product directly to retail to over 22 , 000 retail
location in north america , effectively doubling the company ' s net
profit margins and allowing the increased revenue to pass on to our
artists . "
mr . shebanow concluded , " while there are smaller labels that do provide
a home for these acts , they lack either the will or financial resources
to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the caliber we have
on staff require . and no company has the unique combination of great
producers , in - house distribution and dedication to the artist and the
customer that controversial entertainment will possess . "
