Subject: global risk management
on friday , may 5 , 2000 , rick buy and jeff skillling signed a memo
designating john lavorato ( western hemishere ) and john sherriff ( eastern
hemisphere )
as the responsible parties for signing the daily positiion report . please
obtain greg whalley ' s approval for all dpr ' s prior to that date . going
forward , please coordinate with each as to their preferred method of
designating approval . i assume you will use e - mail until such time that the
executive reports viewer can be changed to accomodate this change . i will
also assume that you are working on that solution unless otherwise informed .
john sherriff / john lavorato
the memo was exactly as had been sent to you in draft form . responsibility
for lng continues to be somewhat unclear , however , as it pertains to global
risk oversight , john sherriff is officially responsible until further notice .
any questions , please call me at 3 - 3324
