Subject: sally ,
thank you again for passing my resume to ted murphy . his recruiter is trying
to work the scheduling between myself and the six people that ted wants me
to meet with . it is all very positive and i appreciate all your help .
i am also very interested in enron broadband services on the commercial
side . with my options and structuring background , i believe that it would be
a great fit . what would be the best way to get my resume in front of ken
rice or the right person in his group ? i am attaching an electronic copy for
easy forwarding .
thank you
rob
