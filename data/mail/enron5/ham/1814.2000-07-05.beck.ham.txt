subject : unify to sap interfaces
we interfaced unify to sap three times today . interface number one ( 8 : 40 am )
was error free . the second interface ( noon ) created duplicate invoices for
those sent in our first interface . the problem that caused the duplication
was that the flag in unify that prevents invoices from being sent to sap
after they have already been interfaced did not work . the problem was
corrected before out third interface at 3 : 15 pm . in the 3 : 15 interface , one
error occurred - - - a counterparty was set up in global as intercompany that
should be third party . this error will be corrected before our next interface
on 7 / 6 am .
overall , i was pleased at how well the interfaces worked today and how fast
the sap and unify teams responded to our issues .
