Subject: re : dec 13 dpr
dear john ,
the following are the amounts that make up the $ 5 . 8 mil . i have looked into
your query and noted that there was a late adjustment not exported to us ( so
not captured in the dpr ) . the adjustment will be reflected in today ' s dpr .
please call me at 713 408 4315 if you have any questions .
best regards

shona ,
pls do the following asap :
introduce yourself to john and make sure he knows the most expeditiious ways
to get information regarding the content of the dpr and executive reports .
pls consider this request . i think it is a good idea to either put comments
on the corp dpr or each business unit should have their own summary executive
report that could give more detail .
john ,
fyi , shona works in sally beck ' s global operations group and ( among 5 , 000
other things ) is in charge of the group that puts together the dpr .
cassandra schultz , who is also copied here , is a vp who works for me in
charge of policy issues and works closely with shona .
my first day physicallyt at enron house is planned for 1 / 8 / 01 .
