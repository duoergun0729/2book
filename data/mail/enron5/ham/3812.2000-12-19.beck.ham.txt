portland will be calculated and officialized on friday , december 22 nd for
trading that day . the current plan is not to publish the dpr for december
22 nd on tuesday , december 26 th , but to wait until the first enron official
business day to do so ( i . e . wednesday , december 27 th ) . that will work as
long as trading results for friday , december 22 nd are not dramatic .
please leave a voice mail message after calcing the books on friday , december
22 nd for chris abel ( x 33102 ) to give him trading results by commodity for
