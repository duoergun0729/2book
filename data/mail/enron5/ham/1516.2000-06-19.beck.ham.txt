Subject: var training
sally ,
angela sprock forwarded your vm to me regarding the var training that you
were looking to set up for your group .
i ' ve taken the liberty of getting in touch with the suppliers to talk to them
about the request and their availability . as well as discussing putting on
the 2 day course solely for you group , i also discussed with them the
possibility of breaking it up and delivering it in shorter modules . although
they considered this , they are insistent that the course structure , the
activities and the content lend themselves better to the 2 day format .
they are a very busy company , in much demand both within enron and other
companies . their earliest available dates are : september 14 - 15 , and september
21 - 22 .
alternatively , they have more flexibility on dates later in the year ( october
onwards - but that may be less of a fit ) .
how does this fit with your group ?
let me know if you want to discuss this further
