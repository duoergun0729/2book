i was going to write that the buying and selling of physical commodity
locally was ok , but that hedging had to be done with regional hub . the
problem with this model is that it describes helsinki before the bust !
another possiblity is the agency model , where the local trader acts under the
direction of the hub trader . this is where helsinki currently is ( although we
also have an independent manager on site ) . however , i am not so happy with
this , and rick causey certainly does not like it . perhaps we should recommend
independent risk managers in every office , but all correspondence and
settlement with regional hub ?
