Subject: re : out of the office - march 2 and march 5
have a good vacation .
i talked to rahil and he is going to focus a significant amount of his time
with your team , from an origination perspective , on what you and i discussed
yesterday . we are also dedicating an analyst full time , that works for marc
eichman in structuring , to work with rahil and your team on getting the
business plan and modeling completed for commercialization .
i am seeing tom gros today at 3 pm to discuss with him what i discussed with
you yesterday .
can we meet again this thursday with you , your commercialization team and
rahil , marc and the analyst to agree on what we want to accomplish in the
next week or so ?
let me know your thoughts .

subject : out of the office - march 2 and march 5
i will be out of the office on vacation on friday , march 2 and monday , march
5 . i will check messages at the end of both business days . my assistant ,
patti thompson ( x 35926 ) will have contact numbers for me . since i will be a
chaperone for my daughter and 80 other girls from the high school drill team
at state competition in dallas , it is unlikely that i will be easily
reachable during the day .
i will be back in the office on tuesday , march 6 .
