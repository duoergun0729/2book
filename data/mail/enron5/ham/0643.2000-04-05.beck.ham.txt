Subject: visit to houston
sally
i will be in houston next week and was wondering if you could spare me some
time to talk about the back office for australia . i am the cfo in sydney and
am currently running the settlements work done down here and i would also
like to go over the results of the audit .
at the moment i have time available both on wed and thursday and would
appreciate it if we could meet up on either of those days if you are
available . ( ac romero in cassandra schultz ' s office is co - ordinating my
schedule ) . carol howes and i are meeting with harry bucalo on tuesday to look
at weather settlements issues so we can also address the related control
issues for this new product if that is convenient .
thanks
