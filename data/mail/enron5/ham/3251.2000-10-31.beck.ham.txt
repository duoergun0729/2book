dear ken ,
just to ensure i understand , it seems you have taken yourself out of the
report writing process . i reviewed the portland report you sent earlier
today and didn ' t see any changes . i thought you were going to call leslie
about getting the info from her and taking a look at it .
please let me know what you understand your responsibilities are as far as
portland is concerned .
thanks
shona

dear shona ,
actually , i am waiting on the deal test samples from leslie ( if this is still
the game plan ) before giving jennifer the total package , which jennifer
understands . she followed up with a call requesting a summary of findings in
lieu of the working papers , at least for now . she is calling me everyday ,
and i think it would be good to bring closure to this . i have not heard
anything from leslie . if you and leslie are happy with the remainder of the
deal test , i will x - ref the working papers as such , and we can ship the
papers on to jennifer .
thanks , shona !

hi shona ,
jennifer stevenson ( aa ) left a voice mail in which she indicated that she was
looking for a summary / recap of the portland review . once the portland report
is finalized , would you forward her the information she requires ?
thank you ,
ken
