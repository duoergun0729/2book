Subject: mariner
i have confirmed our risk review of mariner with the cfo , frank pici , for
thursday april 6 beginning at 9 a . m . and extending though the day . as stated
in my prior lotus notes on march 16 , this review will focus on the finance
and marketing functions of mariner rather than the upstream operations such
as exploration and production . attached is a org chart which was provided by
the company . please let me know if you have any comments .
