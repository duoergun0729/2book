subject : status - " pcg wish list "
i just wanted to give you an update on where we are on the pcg wish list .
we discussed about a month ago the fact that we had close to 200 items on our
list of development / enhancements to our applications . we met on numerous
occasions with mark d . and team to prioritize , etc . however , i think
primarily due to the reorg in it , and mark leaving the team , we have done a
lot of talking over the past three weeks , but nothing has happened to date .
jennifer and i met with hal elrod yesterday , and i have met with bob hillier
a couple of times , and we seem to be on the right track now . i know bob
hiller is looking for people in his group to support these needs .
my concern is growing due to the fact that andrew parsons and team will be
re - auditing us before the end of the year . the key control weakness of the
pcg was the lack of profiles manger - i have stressed that this is # 1 on the
list of things to do . i think we are fairly close , but we will need to start
and complete testing over the next several weeks . my hope is that we push
andrew back as far as possible !
please let me know if you have any questions -
