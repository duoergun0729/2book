Subject: dates for your evening event
hope this helps
i am out of town on the 20 / 21 of april so not able to make it
friday or saturday the 27 th / 28 th of april are fine
saturday the 5 th is ok ( not the prime choice as frank ' s flight gets in from the offsite at 6 pm that night unless he changes it or comes straight to your house - which i am willing to make him do )
we are out of the weekend of the 11 th and 12 th
and ok any other time in may
