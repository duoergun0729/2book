leslie reeves is working on the tom gros project ( let me know if you need
details on this ) . she has asked for top 25 counterparties on enrononline .
in short , there is a new texas law in the works that will allow for
electronic confirming of deals , and they want to determine if any of the top
25 are texas companies so that we can pursue confirming deals
electronically .
just wanted to get your approval before sending it on to her .
thanks
