subject : new global counterparty change request system
just wanted to drop you a note to let you know how pleased we are with the
new global counterparty change request system . i had the opportunity to use
it yesterday . it is very easy to use and very user friendly ! also it is
very efficient , since we no longer have to remember who handles what party of
the alphabet . we love the fact that we can work on a request and save it as
a draft before finalizing it . also like the ability to view our own request
so that we can view the status .
overall , your group has done a great job on this project !
