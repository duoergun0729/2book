subject : suggestions for floor meeting locations
the floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the it teams . between my operations teams dedicated to ea , egm and eim , i have roughly 500 employees in the enron building . do you want all of them to choose one of the floors noted in your e - mail message , or would it be better to schedule one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this segment of net works ? i have noted below the approximate number of employees per floor ( including only those floors with a significant number of operations employees ) :
29 th floor ( trading ) 67 employees egm risk , vol . mgmt . , confirms , settlements and eim risk
30 th floor ( trading ) 35 employees egm risk , confirms , settlements ( various products )
31 st floor ( trading ) 52 employees power risk , confirms , vol . mgnt . , settlements and dpr and mpr teams
32 nd floor ( trading ) 117 employees gas risk , logistics ( all regions ) , operational analysis
37 th floor 148 employees gas vol . mgmt . , settlements , and global services
also , given the fact that operations is a relative " newcomer " to enron networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group , i would be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions . - - sally
