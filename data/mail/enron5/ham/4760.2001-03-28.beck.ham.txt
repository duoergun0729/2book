Subject: wellhead desk - new headcount
this week , the wellhead desk has done more than 150 deals . we need to
discuss adding a headcount ( maybe 2 ) , as originally we were just integrating
the book with the daily business . at the current pace , this is no longer an
option . bob , will this require an additional headcount for logistics as
well ? and , who needs to sign off on this on the commercial side ?
thanks for your help ,
