Subject: transparently controlling the wholesale trading businesses - an
internal approach to internal audit
shawn / shona
we have talked round this issue for some time so i thought i would try to
take a brief stab at documenting what my preferred approach is ( we will need
to do a great deal of talking before we would circulate widely ) : -
aims
accountability for internal controls must rest with the commercial support
teams and absolutely with the leaders of those teams .
a culture of control and operational risk assessment requires extensive
on - going communication and a structure of measurement and tracking .
any independent process of review such as doorstep and brm should fully
leverage the work engaged by staff in the line and indeed should be focused
by it
all elements of implementing , completing and reviewing internal control
should generate defined output
we focus independently the review efforts for trading controls and
origination controls ( we have defined the control structure for trading
offices , agency offices and origination offices and we must police our
labelling for each office )
the output from enron ' s perspective is appropriate risk issue lists to be
discussed at control / governance meetings ( eg at sally / ted / fernley ' s level and
at the audit committee level ) - the important issue here is that every list
must be extracted from an agreed database of issues - different lists have
different amounts of filtering applied - judgementally by senior / experienced
staff
the output from aa ' s perspective is their internal controls audit opinion
based upon our database and our review and management process of it
trading process - monthly
routine judgemental self assessment on areas within the trading transaction
cycle - rating made by business controller is red , amber , green - with trend
indicator of static , improving or declining - see attachment 2 for full
listing
monthly metrics collected for key standards set for risk management - see
attachment 1 ( you will notice that this is a summarised version of attachment
2 - and as a senior controller i would expect the metrics to underpin but not
solely drive the judgement within the self assessment ) - shona , this is the
work that mike moscoso is leading
periodic review meeting between controller and commercial lead to discuss
operational risk and areas of concern ( red and amber ) with agreement of
action plans for such areas
monthly review by controller / senior controller of database where all high
( red ) and medium ( amber ) risk issues are recorded . milestones for action
plans revisited , reconfirmed or amended
monthly meeting between remote office staff and controllers to identify if
the risk rating for any remote offices has changed
all new information on issues raised by self assessment , doorstep review or
brm completion populated into database
database utilised globally to report to various levels of governance and
decision on whether original brm and doorstep plans require amendment
process - yearly planning
checkpoint taken of
current operational environment ( say end oct )
proposed new offices for coming year or proposed changes to activity in
office , and
it development plans for next year
prioritisation made for doorstep - which offices require a visit and what
depth does report need to go to . note the doorstep review would be an end to
end review for entire business unit and therefore is the independent review
of the existing self assessment and would leverage the work by focusing the
review effort on areas of concern , the actions plans in place and concluding
on the ' mitigation of operational risk to an acceptable level '
prioritisation made for brm - which functions , not business units , require
external independent review - highly leveraging the above self assessment and
doorstep processes ( could aa signoff simply by auditing our own internal
governance process ? ) - most likely reviews completed on functions that
assessed as concerns across multiple business - such as fx exposure
management , cash management , credit exposure management , it change management
controls / process
where are we now - if we all thought to do this immediately
we do not have bottom up operational risk assessment for all businesses - i
am suggesting that we demand that all business controllers at the houston
offsite do this ? 23 rd oct
the above would validate a high level operational risk summary that we as
senior controllers could put together for the audit committee - last week oct
we agree on a robust tracking process - throw out one of the brm and doorstep
databases - november
given aa have never historically risk rated their issues we should repopulate
the database from scratch - november
review doorstep plan to check that our risk rating for business units and
remote offices means that we have resource focused correctly - do we need to
visit all ? - november
review all of the above and blend into risk based approach for brm planning -
end november to end december ! !
