Subject: houston trip
hi there - - - had lunch with mo today - - so as you can imagine she was very
interested in my new role , working with you . fernley has decided that it is
too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects
all of the people who reported in to phillip and i , so he has just verbally
announced the changes . but , at any rate , the word is getting out .
i hadn ' t seen mo in months , so it was good to catch up . i think she is
headed to houston this week ( so is frank ) so i am sure you will be hearing
from her .
i have tentatively blocked out the week beginning monday , nov . 13 th to come
over to houston , and would like to spend some of that time with you and your
team , meeting people , and maybe just following you around for the day , as you
suggested .
does that week work for you ? i think the management conference is later in
the month , so people will generally be around .
please let me know , and i will make sure it happens . i will also need to
spend some time with melissa becker and her team working on post ase
reporting solutions , but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with
the north america group .
what do you think ? i am ready to get moving on some new things ! ! ! !
