Subject: re : var for credit trading
please see the attached comment at the bottom of this string of e - mails .
the privilege of using enron ' s balance sheet comes with the responsibility to
adequately report the risk in the form that has been agreed to .
it is appalling to me that we are currently incapable of calculating var in a
product that has been approved for trading for several months . it is equally
appalling that the support staff continues to be so unaware of the importance
of this that the comments below could even be considered reasonable .
obviously , the individual who made the comment is hardly responsible . it
lies with both commercial and commercial support management . i know that
airing this out in such a broad way appears to be harsh . this is not the
point . this is not an isolated problem . it is not just pertaining to
europe . please do not feel singled out . but the scrutiny and pressure on var
as a measure of risk continues to grow at fast pace . we can hardly make any
progress if this is the pervasive attitude . let ' s knock this stuff out one
at a time .

the var engine for credit trading is being built by research in london and it
is intended that var be run daily as soon as they have produced / signed off on
this .

my view : prove its insignificant by calculating it every day , that ' s why the
board approved the limit .

hi chris
i talked with david yesterday and we don ' t think the risk is significant
enough to start calculating a var number . however if you have any queries
feel free to give him a call .
