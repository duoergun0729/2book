subject : envision meeting structures and way forwards
at the last envision project meeting the following presentation was given and agreed in principal as the way we will take things forwards . whilst the names within each area have to be confirmed and agreed i thought that it would be useful to circulate this as many of you will be impacted . i will be communicating this further over the next few days , but if you have any immediate questions please feel free to contact me .
