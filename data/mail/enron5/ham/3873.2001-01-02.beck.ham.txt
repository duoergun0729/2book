steve and i did some ' thinking ' during the downtime between christmas and new
year and we were questioning whether there was a definitive business planning
document for cl - indeed if there was one , has it now been changed to reflect
the new priorities consistent with your involvement and leadership ?
such documentation could assist us in relaunching our envision program which
( as a result of necessity ) has become over the last few months a more
generic change management control process for enron europe
will be in touch
