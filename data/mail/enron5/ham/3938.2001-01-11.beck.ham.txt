Subject: re : london hotel
frank and i are staying at the sheraton belgravia which is about a 5 minute
walk to our office - - it is small and quiet but nice rooms . it is not on a
major street like picadilly or park lane , but we like it . the rate is about
ol 90 a night
we had to move out of our flat on monday , so are staying there until we
leave . right now we are scheduled to fly out on sat the 20 th .
also - - - just a few notes on next week
i am free monday night if you would like to have dinner . i know frank and
maureen will be in spain that night , they are back on tuesday
also my going away party that fernley is throwing is on wed night - - so
hopefully most people will drop by there . it is just a pub thing near the
office , but hopefully you can make it ! i am sure there will be dinner or
something afterwards .
talk to you soon

right now , i am booked at 47 park for next week . i would love to be closer
to the office , but i don ' t know if there is anything that makes sense . any
suggestions ? if not something close to the office , would you suggest another
spot besides 47 park ?
i am committed to working on my agenda for next week before i leave the
office tonight . i will e : mail you tomorrow to see if we can schedule a time
to meet and hopefully a lunch or dinner , too . - - sally
