Subject: transition items
i have a few questions regarding the transition .
access programmers - the contractors will be managed by the end - users they
are supporting from now on . the budget dollars for them are in cc 103849 -
$ 50 k per month . do you want each department to continue paying their
invoices against these budget dollars in 103849 or through their own cost
centers ? do we transfer budget dollars ? close the cost center ?
equipment - we have 1 flat screen and several large monitors . should we just
return all equipment to surplus or offer to others ?
space - will commoditylogic be moving and assuming the space that will be
vacated on 3 / 12 ?
fax machine will be disconnected / returned . digital scanner will be surplused .
there are two printers that can be surplused unless someone else ( cl ? )
wants / needs them . turkeylegs and tarzan .
i currently charge 50 % of my time to cl and 50 % to my cost center - 103850 .
should i continue this or charge all my time to cl and close my cost center
? since marvia is also be redeployed , there is no one else in my cost center .
let me know if you want to sit down and discuss or you can just provide quick
answers here or in voice mail .
