Subject: 2001 vacation
i am planning to take a three week vacation in march of this year . this is a
special trip with my older sister who underwent treatment for breast cancer
last year . i have confirmed that all of my direct reports will be here
during my absence . also , i will have my pager and a laptop with me during
this time . i am planning to book my trip in the next day or two . can you
let me know if you have any problems or concerns with the length of my
planned holiday ? i have already spoken to jon mckay , and he has no problem
with my plans .
thanks
