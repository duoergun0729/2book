at the meeting i was told 2 weeks to a month out . i think they would like to
start earlier and probably came over here with that intention , but they still
have some legal , tax and obviously back office things to sort out ( so
basically as soon as commercially possible ! ) .
they flew back to houston today , so i expect to hear more details in a couple
of days ( after they chase down some legal and tax issues ) . in the meantime ,
we need to get with brenda and her group to sort out the back office details
as soon as possible . as you know , global products is currently only
supporting 10 - 15 financial trades per month ( confirms and settlements through
ectric ) .
regards ,
shelly

thanks for the call . brenda herod is the operations controller for eim .
( brenda and brent in their roles over eim and egm , respectively , are both
direct reports of mine . ) brenda is out of the country through the end of
this week on vacation , touring europe with her mom . if there is a need to
address this issue this week , let me know and i can start down that road
until brenda returns . let me know .
i did hear an unsubstantiated rumor this week that clickpaper . com is set to
go live in london within 5 days . i am trying to find out if that is true .
if it is , it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in houston to do so
this past july without letting anyone in the mid and back office know . we
had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry .
not ideal . i hope that history has not repeated itself . let me know if you
have heard anything on this .
