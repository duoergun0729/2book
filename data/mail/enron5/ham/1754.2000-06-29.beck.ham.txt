souad ,
there are expiration dates for swaptions / options on the " detail " button in
tagg deal capture . let ' s
do the following . go into tagg deal capture and check to make sure these
dates are valid for swaptions / options .
we will write a report that you can run that identifies deals that are
expiring .
thanks , ron

the reason for this message and the other message addressed to jeff johnson
is that we have system modifications that due to system resources may or may
not get done . note the clickpaper comment .

but we will work on whatever is a higher priority from enron ' s point of view .

subject : tagg modification request
ron ,
a series of significant events took place this week where it made it more
apparent that a modification in tagg is highly needed . without going into a
lot of detail regarding the events , the modification desired is simply an
expiration date field for certain types of transactions ( swaptions ) , where a
date is keyed by the user at the time the trade is entered into tagg . in
addition , this feature will permit tagg to prompt the user or users with a
message box of the expiration date and associated deal number at a later
time , before the expiration date becomes current ( i . e . a week before the
expiration date becomes current ) .
this request carries a lot of value for it allows ena to avoid a variety of
risks underlying missing execution of certain types of trades . this issue
was addressed in the past and i would like to raise it again .
can we implement such modification ? your prompt response is highly needed and
your feedback is appreciated .
thanks .
i work on the confirmation desk , reporting to jeff sorenson . please call me
if you have any questions or suggestions ( x 37580 ) .
