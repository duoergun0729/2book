Subject: london doorstep phase i responsibility matrix
this is the latest draft that i have of the matrix . john has seen this
version ; i am not certain if he has seen any updates .
please let me know the outcome of your conversation with fernley - i am
somewhat discouraged by john ' s remarks and would like to get any
misconceptions cleared up as soon as possible ( whether i assume a position in
london or not ) .
