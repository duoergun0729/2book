Subject: lunch w / sally this thursday , june 1
hi ted ,
i had sally blocked off from 11 : 00 to 1 : 00 for lunch this thursday , but we
will need to change time to 11 : 30 instead - a meeting that she must attend
has been scheduled until 11 : 30 . sally says it would be great if you and tim
pick her up out front at that time . do you have a cell phone number ? i will
make reservations for the 3 of you at irma ' s .
also , i talked to cathy in mike mcconnell ' s office about lunch june 20 .
unfortunately , he will be in s . korea during that time . per cathy , he is
making 3 overseas trips this month ( s . korea , brazil & japan ) so he will be
quite busy . she did say for you to keep trying .
