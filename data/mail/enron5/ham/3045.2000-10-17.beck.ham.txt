Subject: doorstep - rac responsibilities
upon further consideration , the ongoing responsibility of doorstep activities
will fall to the market risk ( ted murphy et al ) group within rac . my original
intention here was to streamline a costly and time consuming process and for
whatever reason it seems the exact opposite goal has been achieved . please
discontinue any activities related to this project . thanks , rick
