subject : doorstep expenses
per discussion with rac management , during the budget approval process rac ' s
initial budget for doorstep was eliminated . consequently , we cannot accept
any charges from eas for travel expenses .
ted murphy indicated that rick causey stated at the inception of doorstep
that doorstep costs should be charged to the business unit subject to the
doorstep visit .
if you have any other questions , give me a call .
regards ,
cassandra .
