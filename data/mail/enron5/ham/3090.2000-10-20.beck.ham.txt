subject : oct . 17 rrc letter re continuing audit violations
i just received a letter from ed abrahamson at the railroad commission ,
asserting that we have still not fully corrected or explained all of the
audit violations they previously alleged . i will have delivered to each of
you this afternoon a copy of the letter , to which we must respond by october
27 . the tone of the letter indicates some frustration on the audit staff ' s
part , and it will behoove us to try to get the remaining matters resolved
promptly .
i will be out of town monday , but i will have my assistant , monica jackson ,
set up a meeting for tuesday afternoon to discuss how we are going to satisfy
the commission regarding the remaining exceptions . in the meantime , please
carefully review each item and commence doing whatever needs to be done to be
in a position to finalize our response by october 26 , thursday of next week .
i think some of the fixes will be fairly easy , but others will be more
problematic . please provide this memo and a copy of the letter to anyone who
should be aware or involved .
