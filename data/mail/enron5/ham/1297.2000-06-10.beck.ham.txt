mary ,
one of our team members , anshuman srivastav , is currently in houston . it
would probably be useful for the 2 of you to meet , so that we can understand
exactly what your plans are with regards to lng and what exactly you will
require as far as contracts go .
failing that , the person , who is the official keeper of all our contracts ,
is sandeep katwala . he should be able to get you whatever you need .
let me know if you have any difficulties and i can try and hunt stuff down .

i am seeking information on where to find copies of lng contracts that were
previously in the domain of the old enron international company . enron
north america will be establishing a risk book to manage lng positions on a
worldwide basis and we need copies of all contracts to set this up . these
contracts may or may not be related to the dabhol project . if you can
provide guidance or information as to where to find these contracts , i would
appreciate it . you may respond via email or call me at 713 - 853 - 6079 in
houston .
thank you for your attention .
