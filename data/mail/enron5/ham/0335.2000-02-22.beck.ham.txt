Subject: transition
dear friends and colleagues ,
i wanted to give you the courtesy of hearing directly from me that i
submitted my resignation earlier today . with a bright and busy 10 - month at
home and another along the way , i am finding it difficult to manage my
priorities and balance my time with ever - increasing job responsibilities . i
know that i will not work when i have the second child and want to make the
most complete and successful transition as possible for both myself and
enron .
i have yet to discuss with sally my departure date , but have left it open for
discussion since i have no urgent deadline to meet . i know that i owe the
southern cone some more process flows , which i fully intend to deliver .
i have greatly enjoyed the past four years at enron , and will miss many
aspects of my job and the company . if you have any specific requests prior
to my departure , or recommendation regarding length of notice , i would
appreciate hearing from you .
