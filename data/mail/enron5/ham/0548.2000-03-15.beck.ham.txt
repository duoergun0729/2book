Subject: re : killed eol deals
the aquila issue has been largely addressed : the killed deals have been
primarly due to one trader there - par o ' kane , and i ' ve spoken with him on
this . i think this will resolve the problem . the kock issue seems to be a
hardware issue on their side , and i spoke with the head of it / b to b there
and she assured me they are trying to resolve this issue . i offered one of
our tech guys to visit their shop . jeff

subject : killed eol deals
sally asked that i forward the detail of the " killed " eol transactions to
both of you . we have emphasized the importance of stressing to our customers
that a deal transacted via enrononline is a binding / legal transaction , but we
have continued to see a few of these deals occur . in summary , we have had a
total of 33 killed transactions since inception , the majority of which have
been with aquila ( 5 ) , koch ( 8 ) , and internal trades ( 13 ) . obviously , the
ones that concern us the most are those transactions with third parties , and
most of these have been due to claimed web latency and transactions not
appearing on the customer ' s summary report . it is important to stress to the
commercial team that the way to " get out of a trade " is to do an offsetting
trade or have our legal dept prepare a termination agreement . please feel
free to pass my name on to your respective groups as a point of contact to
work with legal in the case of a terminated deal .
feel free to call me with any questions ( x 36557 ) .
