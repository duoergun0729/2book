Subject: fundamental operating standards
i just looked over your draft of the fundamental operating standards again .
i think they are very good and i am just worried about completeness ( what are
we missing ) . one thing that occurs to me is logistics and somehow
reconciling planned physical activity to scheduled activity to actual
recorded and settled activity . is this covered somehow ? ? hope all is well .
