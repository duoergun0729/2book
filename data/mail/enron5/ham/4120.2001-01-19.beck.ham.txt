Subject: var calcs .
could you please ensure that sufficient resources are dedicated to fixing the
current var calculation problem as soon as possible . jenny , stacey , and
vlady are spending a significant amount of time trying to repair the var
calc model , which is outside the scope of what we originally discussed in our
meeting several weeks ago .
your attention to get quick resolution to this issue would be greatly
appreciated .
thanks sally .
