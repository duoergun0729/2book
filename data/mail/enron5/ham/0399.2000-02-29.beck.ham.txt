subject : customer feedback
i have received a copy of the recent customer feedback forms which provide a
powerful compliment to the work which you have all been doing in providing a
first - class level of service to our customers .
i am very impressed that so many customers have been motivated to make such
positive comments . even more amazing is that i could not see a single
negative comment anywhere in the stack . this is especially impressive , given
the nature of a call center providing customer service to an it product .
many thanks to all of you for the job you have been doing . you make all of us
look good .
