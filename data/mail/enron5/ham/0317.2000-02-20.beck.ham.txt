barry ,
please make sure that someone in the dpr - houston team gets these memos as
well .
i would recommend copying mike moscoso on any notices that you send me .
i am sure that it is confusing , but eventually we will get it right .
thanks

bp - you were going to send the limit violation memo previously forwarded to
t murphy on apx as well ( ie . p & l ) ? it will be easier to get this from you as
murphy is out on business . when do you expect to complete the memo for the
incremental ( 10 mm ) loss on the apx positions to be run through today ' s dpr ?
going forward , make sure to copy both port and i on this and similar items .
thanks .
