Subject: ase attendees
here is my list . i also touched base with brent , bob , and leslie to see who
they wanted to include from their staff as well .
we ' re a little over the suggested max of 25 people . i ' ve made a call to lisa
petruska to see if 25 is a firm number or if we can go a little over . please
review and make and additions / deletions you see fit and then return . i will
send out the notice to get this on everyone ' s calendar once i have your
updates .
i suggest we let each department handle flight arrangements , but that we
centrally coordinate lodging .
