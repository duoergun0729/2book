Subject: sap go - live review by aa
richard -
attached is an outline of the involvement we ' ve engaged aa to perform for
each business unit as they go - live onto sap . please remember that ena is
going live onto sap ' s " common design " that has already been reviewed by aa
from a internal controls perspective . so this attachment outlines those
items outside of " common design " that wanda and sally probably want covered
from an ena perspective . as a rule of thumb , this proposed scope equates to
$ 100 k - $ 150 k in fees to aa that is over & above the audit budget .
one word of advice : designate a lead within ena that has the time to stay on
top of the project , schedule meetings with aa , and coordinate their
involvement with the sap team members , e . g . not wanda or sally , but at a
director / manager level at least . i was the designee for corp and ensured
that aa kept the project going . also , i worked extensively with the janet
tran , sap lead director responsible for bringing corp up . some big benefits :
kept aa out of sap ' s hair when things got rough .
made sure that the sap team knew what our goals & objectives were , especially
when we found something that needed fixed before go - live .
managed that in fact aa provided us a deliverable at the end of the project .
please review and call if you need other info . i ' d be glad to assist ena
too . i assisted europe ( naomi connell ) and int ' l cos ( john berggren ) . they
appreciated having a " co - pilot " and we avoided duplication of effort with
what had already been done for the prior go - lives . also , they felt that
value was rec ' d for dollars paid to aa for this work .
