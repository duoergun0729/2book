Subject: reporting line for sydney risk officer
scott
with all our reporting changing to london office and now it appears some
restructure of risk and the broadening of sally ' s role , what are we going to
do for the second report for our new risk manager , justin den hertog - he has
taken over from alan .
he reports to me locally , but functionally he would traditionally have
reported to you on behalf of sally ' s area . i assume this has now moved with
the rest of us and would therefore be either james new or mike jordan in
london ? can you please advise me via return email as we are working on our
pep stuff , reviews etc .
with thanks
