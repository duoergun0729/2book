Subject: unify use of tibco in production
sally ,
as you know , we have been working to find new ways to improve unify logistics
functions . a major step has now been achieved by installing tibco and moving
it into production today .
utilizing tibco in conjunction with our other enhancements will enable
logistics to obtain real time updates from both eol and sitara without having
to re - retrieve them from the database . this will automatically update
scheduler screens with new deals as it comes without action on their part and
also reduce required database access . this has been achieved through great
team work between many groups including logistics schedulers , unify it
logistics & ade , unix and network people . please let me know if you want
to know more details . thank you .
