Subject: oslo - next week
hey brent ,
jan erland has just called me from oslo , he told you & bjorn are due over
there next week .
i guess i ' m a little surprised no one told me , as jan erland reports to me .
he is local office controller . i ' m assuming it will be a ' post - helsinki '
type review , right ? is there any particular things they / you would like to
look at or discuss ?
as you know we operate some of the ibs functions from oslo and some from
london . i ' m happy to discuss this further . do your people need an
introduction to the operation etc . . . ?
hope your well , barry .
