subject : re : intern acceptances and declines
last summer we hosted a lunch for summer interns right at the end of their assignments with us . we had other ut alums attend the lunch . feedback from the summer interns was favorable . their key comment , though , was that it would have been great to have had that get together earlier in the summer so that the interns could have networked with other enron ut alums throughout the summer . can we plan something for the ut interns earlier this summer ? it would probably work well to include the summer associates as well . i will be glad to help in any way . just let me know .
