Subject: action from last doorstep meeting
ted / sally
we took as an action from the last meeting the need to re - authorise all
traders within the metals global businesses , sign this list off with the
enronmetals managing directors and accompany this list with a note
highlighting the dangers of non authorised trading activity .
due to the storm here yesterday we had to delay the operational control
meeting with the mds until today and therefore hope to have this out tomorrow
with effect from cob 31 st .
apologies for the delay - any issues please call
regards
mike
