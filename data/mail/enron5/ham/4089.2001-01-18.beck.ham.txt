subject : global rates
i thought i would share with you my ideas in regard to my upcoming trip to
london .
i would like to meet with you and james new for about an hour when i first
arrive to get a feel of your businesses and to give both of you an update on
the new and improved global rates group . i would also appreciate it if i
could unobtrusively sit with several of your risk groups in order to among
other things , get an idea of the types of commodities london trades and their
respective exchanges and to become familiar with the current process that
london uses to capture commodity rates .
after a couple of days , i am confident that i could have an idea of how
global rates could be of the most benefit to london .
this trip would of course be charged to the global rates cc and not allocated
back to london , since it is a " discovery " trip , which we have budgeted for
in our 2001 budget .
i wouldn ' t want this to interfere in anyway with your ongoing business ,
therefore would you please let me know when you and james would be in london
during the next couple of weeks and i will schedule my trip accordingly .
thanks again for your assistance , it is unfortunate that our teleconference
scheduled for today got cancelled .
