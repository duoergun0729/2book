sally ,
per dorie , there will be an interactive invitation to office of the chair
offsite ( probably the beginning of next week ) . with a click , you will rsvp &
indicate whether or not you need airline reservations . if so , you will be
forwarded to a travel agent who has been selected to make these
reservations . do you want me to make back - up reservations just in case
preferable flights get booked early ?
