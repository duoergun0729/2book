Subject: todd hall
sally ,
it has taken a few weeks for me to write this memo , but i wanted to make sure
that i thanked you for making todd available to us in london . todd was a
great help . he provided the experience , professionalism and insight that we
were lacking on book splitting team . todd did a very good job of moving the
process forward and outlining some projects that need to undertaken in the
future . i hope that he will have the time to come back to london once or
twice to help evaluate the progress made on his ideas .
thanks again ,
joe
ps if you have anyone of todds caliber that needs a new challenge , please let
me know .
