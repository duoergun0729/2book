Subject: enron japan trading
hi , how is everyone doing ? busy , busy , busy i know .
i am currently in the middle of selecting our japan banking relationship and
several questions have come up .
it is important that i understand how your trading settlements will work .
i have spoken to louise kitchen about enron online and where it fits in with
our banking . enron online does not interface with the banking . it
interfaces with a trading system / accounting system ? what i need to know is
what system is planned for enron japan ' s accounting for the trading . the
accounting system you use will interface with our treasury system .
what it boils down to , is the payment format that we will use to make local
japanese payments may need special programming to meet the needs of the
japanese - english translation . the accounting system used will need to
interface with our treasury software to process the settlements , we will need
to interface with the bank .
please advise .
thank you ,
pam perry
