Subject: re : mpr for 6 / 20 / 00
mr . hall ,
i have just reviewed the merchant portfolio summary for 6 / 20 and have the
following questions :
1 ) calme shows an asset of $ 291 . 9 mm and apachi shows an asset of $ 113 . 0 mm
and they show no p & l for the year
is this possible in a world of changing interest rates and equity premiums
and commodity prices ?
2 ) india recently invested in an ipo ( rediff . com ) for which there was a
simultaneous dash to buy and sell ( sounds like a merchant deal ) .
where does this show up ?
3 ) there are several bonds ( publicly traded , registrered securities , housed
in our prime broker accounts ) owned by various enron entities
that i do not believe are on the dpr . shouldn ' t they be ? and if so , who is
deciding not to include ?
pls advise at your earliest convenience as you always do .
thanks
ted
