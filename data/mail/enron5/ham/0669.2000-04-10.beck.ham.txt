paul ,
while i think it is reasonable for you to request an increase to your limits ,
as you may know , the board doesn ' t meet until may 2 . it would be somewhat
unprecedented to leave a " proprietary " position over the limit for that
length of time , i . e . , the australian electricity book would far exceed the
number of position limit violations for any other commodities . i have left a
message for greg and will speak to rick buy today . in the meantime , i
suggest that you put together a request for approval to increase your limits
to be presented at the first opportunity .
