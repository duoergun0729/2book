dorothy -
please advise lisa that our expectation is that each business unit will
largely have the final say in establishing office space standards for their
workforce ( as is the case today ) .
corporate may intercede only to the point that a business unit fails to
design to a sufficient density ( average sq . ft . per workplace ) and does not
meet minimum . hard policy has not been set but we expect to gain consensus
from enron ' s executive committee before detailed space planning begins .
