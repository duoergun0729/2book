Subject: re : further follow up
i have asked shelly jones to send me a complete list of the analysts from ou
that will start in july . i ' ll will contact her again
today if she doesn ' t get back with me .
i think it would be a great idea to invite ted . his e - mail is
tjacobs @ ou . edu . it might also be a good idea to invite george hope .
i will also ask shelly if they have assigned a recruiter to ou yet . this
would be a great opportunity for the individual to
meet with the potential recruiting team .
p . s . if i am thinking too much , and the list is growing larger than what you
had anticipated , let me know
