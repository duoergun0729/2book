are you aware or should you be aware of this . . . . .
there are several issues with this , the main one being that we get the
biggest bang for our " gives " to ibm . .
it seems the way this is set up , ibm will piecemeal us and get a lot of work
without a significant " get " for enron ( ie an outsourcing or a bandwidth or
other deal )
are there it and process issues ? is sally involved . maybe they are
self - contained and none of this is anyone ' s business .
i would like your thoughts . . . . .
