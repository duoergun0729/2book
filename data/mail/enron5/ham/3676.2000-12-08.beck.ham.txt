i ' m pretty sure that i saw your name on my calendar sometime this week to
talk about glenn surowiec , but then it disappeared . i would be happy to let
you know how he ' s done ( he was pre - ranked in superior at ebs , so i imagine
you ' re going to need some ammunition . ) since i will be in the meeting as
well , i can speak up when details need to get hashed out . if i mistakenly
missed our appointment , i apologize . let me know if i can help .
see you wednesday . . .
