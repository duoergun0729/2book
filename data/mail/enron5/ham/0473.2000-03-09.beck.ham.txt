sally ,
thanks for calling last night .
i ' ve spoken to joe gold ( md ) and james new ( my power director ) and we will be
delighted to have todd over for a month .
we need him here for monday 20 th march - for 4 weeks - thru 15 th april . full
time .
i guess he should plan to fly over next weekend to be here for the monday -
bright and early . the timing is crucial .
he would work jointly with neil tarling ( director ) on the project - basically
- to seperate the continental power book into 4 / 5 regional books - complete
with individual portfolio ' s , fully documented inter - book trades , currency
functionality and control gates . he will be working with traders , comm supp &
it .
i suggest todd touches base with james - project ' lead ' - to get some
backgroung information about the market .
i think the ' sally will pay ' line swung it with the commercial folks . . . . . . i
said we had a free option - we can always send him home . . . .
speak to you real soon .
