subject : re : tds project
i guess i have several comments to make to this string of mails . . . . so why not
add one more mail . . .
first off , thomas is following up on my suggestion to check into tds as when
we met a few weeks ago ( on other issues ) i heard about tds by name for the
first time - although i admit i was aware of work being done to replace the
applix functionality . you had remarked that you liked the tds functionality
and wondered whether that was the way to go rather than continue to evolve
enron grid . it is unfortunate that bill is not more cooperative with thomas '
request - more in the continuing saga of poor communication and information
sharing between our two teams .
clearly there needs to be much more communication and sharing of information
as global rate services for many months ' bowed ' to the sitara team ' s
priorities for enron grid - which you now say probably won ' t be used . there
are many priorities in the wings to benefit the processes of global rate
services that without has caused us to continue to experience a high rate of
errors - causing large impact to the p however enrongrid is the responsibility of a
different group
( logically , this needs to come together under the same group ) .
does the tds / tibco infrastructure make sense ( current enrongrid / rate server
design assumes the curves are always updated to the rate sever database and
then messaged from the database ( potential performance impact ) ; whereas
tibco infrastructure does not require a database update first )
does the mkm curve publish / subscribe supersede everything and provide a
" better " global technical solution ( part of the london curve manager
development team will be in
houston next week ; therefore a briefing of the mkm curve manager is
something that we are trying to get done ) . functionally , this will require a
more vigorous gap
analysis review before a decision can be made .
i am open to additional discussions on the technical direction , but i do not
think that alot of additional functional documentation needs to be done and
timelines are not changing .

bill ,
i don ' t think anyone outside of sitara knows of tds . if you could give
myself and other interested parties a demo of tds ; i don ' t have a good
understanding of the tds project . if the project is similar to the enron
grid as it is indicated in yannis ' s response , the business users need to come
together and decide the system of choice . yannis makes good points of how to
come to a decision . i would change that the users provide the important
features , advantages , and shortcomings of each product as they see it . i
would gather the users ' needs and timeline . after deciding , i would then
like to get it involved to finalize a decision . i would like to get the
discussion started fairly soon due to the impeding business needs .
the first thing i would suggest is have a demo of both products to inform all
impacted business users . bill , can we setup a demo for tomorrow or early
next week .

bill ,
i have had presentations of both of these projects ( that is not to say that i
know them well ) .
since , according to scott the choice is still open , we have to make a
concious decision as to which way we go . in my mind , this is a decision that
has to be made by the user with my team ' s support . i do not want and should
not drive this decision . the decision should be driven by the user , based on
usage ( business ) requirements . what the phoenix group will provide is a
server that does ( or soon will ) satisfy your business requirements . the
front end plug in is , i think , a decoupled issue in a server - client
environment .
on the other hand , i think we should help you with the choice ( if you so want
us ) . i would actively consult with you to set up the choosing process , which
i imagine would go somewhat like this :
i would suggest that we do , again and all deciding parties together , get
demos of each of these products .
business should put together a bullet point list of the functionality needed
( even a timeline ) and how the tool will be used so both allan and mike
understand your needs clearly .
i also suggest that we ask tds and enron grid to provide us with a short
document outlining the important features , advantages and shortcomings of
each product as they see it . released features should be separated from
future improvements ; the latter should be be accompanied by a time line .
limitations should be listed explicitly .
we take our impressions from the demos along with the writeups in a room and
make the decision .
if needed , business might have to spend the time to play with each of these
products for a short period of time .
in my mind it is important to make choices like this one that will affect
business for a long time based on enumerated and well understood facts ( such
that usually get lost from a short demo ) .
please let me know what you think ,
yannis

i ' m not sure what you want to go over . if you and yannis would like to have
a demo of the tds & grid applications let me know & i ' ll try to set something
up with scott also , so we can discuss grid / tds curve manager / mkm .

bill ,
can you give me more information to the tds you are working on like the due
dates , the scope , etc . if you got some requirements documents or the
business plan on the project , it would be better . i just want to get a
better picture of how enron grid fits in the big picture .
thanks ,
thomas
