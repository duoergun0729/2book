Subject: dpr timing
oliver ,
we would like to push up the consolidated dpr delivery time to approximately
1 pm houston time . we are contemplating setting an 11 : 00 am deadline for all
information we receive daily to prepare the dpr . this would require the
london summary to be delivered by 5 pm london time . please let me know your
thoughts regarding this initiative and if there is anything we can do to help
speed up the whole process .
thanks ,
mike
