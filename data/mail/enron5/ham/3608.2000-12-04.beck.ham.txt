i would welcome the opportunity to walk you through these presentations if
you have time . it has been 6 weeks - 2 months since we did an integration
update for rick and hopefully this will demonstrate that we are out of
integration and managing more in the line as if it was any other business -
with it ' s usual set of problems .
i am also using this report to update joe gold who has been moved by the
office of the chair to president of the enronmetals group
hope all is well
