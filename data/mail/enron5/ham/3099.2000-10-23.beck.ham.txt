i believe that all of you have met frank ( whose last name i can ' t remember ) ,
the hr generalist who is currently working with hector to serve the hr needs
for energy operations in ena . frank is working on a contract basis at this
time , and sheila walton is seeking feedback on his performance to date in
order to evaluate the duration of his work as a contractor and the
feasibility of bringing him in as an employee . i have given sheila my
feedback , but suggested to her that you may have had more contact with frank
than i have had . please take the time to send sheila an e : mail message or
voice mail to let her know what your experiences have been in working with
frank . your input will be very valuable to sheila . thanks for taking the
time to do this .
