Subject: opportunity to discuss
sally
i feel i already know you having had the benefit of sitting next to brent for
the last few months - but i realise i have been impolite in not organising a
call just to introduce myself and arrange dates for a visit to houston .
additionally brent , shona and i have spent some excellent time on the subject
of internal control enivronment / operational risk / doorstep and i wanted to
agree potential next steps with you .
do you have anytime today / tomorrow ?
regards
mike
