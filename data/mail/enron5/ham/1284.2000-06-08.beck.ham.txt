north america will be establishing a risk book to manage lng positions on a
worldwide basis and we need copies of all contracts to set this up . these
contracts may or may not be related to the dabhol project . if you can
provide guidance or information as to where to find these contracts , i would
appreciate it . you may respond via email or call me at 713 - 853 - 6079 in
