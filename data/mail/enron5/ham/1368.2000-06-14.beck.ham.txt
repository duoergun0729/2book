sally and scott earnest called this afternoon . we will be setting up a new
risk book to manage lng positions on a worldwide basis . supposedly , there
are several contracts from the old e . i . entity related to india for lng .
they may reference dabhol power project , fuel management , fuel oil , heating
oil . . . .
scott desperately needs to get copies of these contracts . can you ask around
with some of the contacts you made on your india trip to see if you can find
these and get copies ?
