Subject: analyst prc process
you asked yesterday if any of us had any comments on the analyst prc
process . . . i thought i would share a few things with you . the primary
concern was that an individual was representing " our " people , and they 1 ) did
not know them 2 ) did not know what they did 3 ) probably could not adequately
answer questions about that person and his / her performance and job
responsibilities . although i think the manager ' s in my group did an
excellent job of providing feedback and accomplishments ( the two analysts
rankings in our group did not change from excellent ) , they were really uneasy
about someone independent of our group representing them .
also , in general , it seems like the analysts are getting conflicting messages
about the " third " rotation and the option of going back to school , staying
with the company , etc . i think a good idea would be to provide some clear ,
written message to the analysts and us about the program and how it is going
to work going forward . it surer seems like it changes every 6 months . . .
hope this helps ! let me know if you have any questions .
