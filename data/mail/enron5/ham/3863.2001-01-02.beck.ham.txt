we didn ' t really cover the role you intended to play with ees and ebs as far
as doorstep is concerned when we met with causey / buy . ( or i just can ' t
remember . ) may we include ees and ebs in the scope of our one doorstep
project , and continue to work with shona , also coordinating with wanda and
barry when ees and ebs are involved ? things like the event below might make
us re - consider our need to visit " origination " offices . i don ' t think this
office was on any of our lists .

ltv steel , a counterparty of clinton gas , which is a subsidiary of ees went
bankrupt . ees exposure is ~ $ 6 million . this transaction has not been approved
by the credit group and it seems that they have little clue about enron ' s
processes and procedures . i believe clinton gas is located in dublin , ohio
and suggest that it be included on the door step list .
