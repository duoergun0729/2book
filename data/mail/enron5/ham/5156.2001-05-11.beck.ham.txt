fred - - i think this looks good . frank and i briefly discussed yesterday . can you bring to the wider group on monday to get their input .
remember to encourage them not too be too detailed , as that will be hard to administrate , but hopefully they have some input on the commitments we have included .
beth
ps can you schedule a meeting mid to late next week after frank incorporates this info into the contract for the 3 of us to review ? i am out at a conference on monday and tuesday

here ' s a copy of the latest draft of the service levels that we may expect to adhere to . we might also start to think about what would happen if we don ' t meet the performance levels indicated . what do we offer up ? how will it be handled . this could possible be addressed in a separate section .
see you later today ,
