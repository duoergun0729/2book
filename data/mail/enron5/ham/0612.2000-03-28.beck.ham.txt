subject : signing of confirmations
alan further to our discussion last friday ( your thursday ) . the current
practice remains whereby confirmations are sent sue ( to be replaced scott )
for signature . however , in recent times due to sue ' s unavailability heidi has
been called upon to sign confirmations using her backup authority ( on approx .
3 occasions ) .
the report arising from the recent " project doorstop " audit of the sydney
office included recommendations on development of a back office function in
sydney . this is under active discussion .
