all ;
as i mentioned this morning at cindy ' s hr leadership meeting , we plan to
delete the mid - year 2000 feedback from our system on 17 november 2000 . would
you kindly communicate this to your clients , to ensure that any outstanding
final evaluations for mid - year 2000 are completed before that date .
supervisors who may need to obtain consolidated feedback on their employees
or to obtain final evaluation forms may call the houston pep help desk on
( 713 ) 853 - 4777 ( option 4 ) or via e - mail to pep help desk employee vincent
cassata ( vincent . cassata @ enron . com ) .
