subject : internal feedback for prc
i have completed internal feedback forms through the pep system for brent
price , bob hall and peggy hedstrom . those appeared to be the only names that
you included for which you wanted my input . somehow , from andrea ' s voice
mail message last week , i had anticipated responding to more requests - i
thought perhaps input in working with wes within ena or melissa on sap .
those weren ' t on my list within the pep system , so i just wanted you to know
that i have responded to the three that were there . if there was intent for
me to respond to any others , they weren ' t accessible in the system . ( believe
me , i am not asking for more - just wanted to be sure that what i saw in pep
as a request matched your expectations in terms of my response ) . - - sally
