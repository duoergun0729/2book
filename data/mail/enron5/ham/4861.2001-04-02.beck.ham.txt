Subject: update from calgary
there are a couple of items that i wanted to update you on with respect to our outsourcing arrangements and staffing . first , the outsourcing arrangement with petro - canada has been extended for an additional five - year term . the commercial guys are very happy about this and have given a lot of credit to energy operations and accounting for the successful renewal of this agreement .
secondly , we have an existing outsourcing agreement with startech energy for volumes totaling 8 - 10 mmcf / d . these properties have been purchased by a company called arc . the existing msa for startech properties is being terminated and a new agreement covering all of arc ' s production is in the final stages of negotiation . starting in may / june , the volumes under this new arrangement will be between 50 - 60 mmcf / d . this increased volume and associated receipt points creates the need to add one person to the logistics group . this position was not budgeted for , however , i have received approval from rob milnthorp to add this position . please let me know if you have any concerns about this net staff addition .
thanks
