Subject: re : annual report var disclosures - open items
i spoke to greg adams on the eog commodity affiliate positions . he has never
supplied var on these . we have no information on these . you need to ask
whoever supplies you the quarterly numbers to supply you with the non - quarter
end months .

subject : annual report var disclosures - open items
this is part ii of the open items on var , addressing ecm , pge & affiliate
books
from my review of eugenio ' s consolidated var spreadsheet , the following
listed items are those that are open that we need information from
you on . corp . is looking to type the first draft of the annual report ( to
be discussed with the audit committee ) this friday , so we need your help with
this information as soon as possible . if you will not be able to have all of
the information to eugenio by thursday night , please let me know . we may be
able to give you some additional time to gather some of the smaller pieces .
if you need to forward this on to others , please do so .
aa if you know of any other issues of completeness that i have not addressed ,
please let eugenio and i know !
* have aa and jan johnson concluded that we only need to include the puts on
the enron stock ? if so we need all twelve months of comparable data as
applicable . steve ross sent to eugenio on monday ( yesterday ) . let him
know if he needs to re - send it .
* are the swaps shown on the ecm fn 3 schedule for the phantom stock plan the
puts that we have been talking about ? if not do these swaps need to be
included in var and the non - trading portion of fn 3 ? i haven ' t seen them
before . these are new puts . i checked with jan . she said to include the
positions as non - trading equity . the trades were both done in november by
gary hickerson ' s group . be sure he hasn ' t included them in his numbers .
we ' ll get the var for november and december to you on wednesday . ( steve ,
this is yours ) .
* what is yosemite ? is it a trs that i need to include in var and fn 3 ?
internally we call it a swap but in the legal document it is called an
agreement . it ' s actually more of a guarantee . i talked to jan about it and
we don ' t think it goes in fn 3 .
* for non - trading i \ r and f \ x , we are still missing all non - quarter end
months . jeff , this ones yours . we need to send the information to
research and have them run the var monthly in 2000 also .
* pge - january , february and march var is missing on eugenio ' s schedule . i
don ' t have a clue what pge ' s information is . i only know about rhythms which
is in a separate section . you ' ll have to ask pge .
* what month was the eog sale effective ? we need commodity affiliate for all
of the non - quarter end months prior to the sale . the sale took place august
16 . i have never even heard of any eog commodity affiliate position . i was
told greg adams handled these at one point . i ' ll ask him tomorrow .
