subject : working together on the valuation model
all ,
as we go forward on the next revision of the valuation model ( due late next week or early the next for the offsite ) , it is important that we all understand and embrace some basic ground rules . i ' ve got some suggestions below and would like to hear any that you have :
in order to maintain coordination and control of the information - for the betterment of us all - i think we ought to give one person version control responsibility over the model . this person should be advised when the model is updated . relating things like the effects on the valuation and reasons for the updating also seem pertinent . version control is critical if we are to maintain consistency in our approach to upper management .
related to this , rahil should be made aware when the model is distributed to upper management ( both sally and greg ) and be given the opportunity to give feedback before hand .
just basic stuff , but if we can all agree to maintain this protocol before we go much further , we should be able to avoid any unnecessary complications .
thanks ,
fred
