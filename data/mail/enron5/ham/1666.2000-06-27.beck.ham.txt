sally , i met with jeff shankman , hunter shively , fletch sturm and laura luce
yesterday re : chicago resources . everyone is in agreement that we need to
assign the overall chicago office support activities to one individual within
your group who will be completely responsible for activities relative to deal
booking , dpr accuracy , p / l accuracy , transfer pricing accuracy , accounting ,
scheduling , ( eol activity support ? ) , etc . this will be a full - time job i
think . could we make this happen asap . let ' s get together and discuss if need
be . thanks sally !
