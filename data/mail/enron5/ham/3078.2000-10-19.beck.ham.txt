Subject: portland doorstep report - finding followed up on
dear ken , leslie ,
it looks like we have gotten to the bottom of the missing documentation ( it
was there , it was quickly available , ken did talk to the right people but
they did not see the urgency of getting the information to ken ) . as a
result , i think we have to rewrite the information related to this issue in
the portland report . let ' s get together for 15 minutes today / tomorrow to
draft a rewrite of these areas .
just as a side note , we need to wait until the report has been changed before
we share the information with portland .
pam - could you organize ken , leslie and i getting together ?
thanks
shona
