financial targets for 2000 ;

opportunities . specifically , we are asking the origination groups to
describe their current strategy , detail the top 5 commercial
deals / opportuntities for 2000 and to discuss any resource or organizational
issues facing the unit . each trading organization will be asked to give a
short market overview of their markets , identify three market or trading
opportunities and discuss any resource or organizational issues facing that
