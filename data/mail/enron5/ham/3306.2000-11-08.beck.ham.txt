how about this for a business model for an origination and trading outfit .
salesperson talks to customer
customer agrees to trade
salesperson phones trading desk and gets price ( trading desk is london or ny
- nb : all lines are taped )
salesperson tell customer
customers says ok
salesperson says " done " to customer and trading desk
trading desk books deal , middle and back office processes kicks in , sends out
and chases up confirm etc
accounting process identifies value added by salesperson and gives them a
piece of the price as a credit
no bank accounts or signing authority in sales office
no accountants , middle office people or other similar humans in the sales
office , just sales people
all hedging and risk taking resident in trading books in ny or london
can we not make this work ?

as discussed , given joe ' s comments below , a note to confirm that this being
dealt with internally .
rob soeldner has made it clear to joe that :
enron places great importance on trading controls . these are non - negotiatable .
the suggested course of action is not an option
we aren ' t seeking to close any of the agency offices given implemetation of
these controls .
joe is not in yet - rob will be discussing with him further when the us gets
in .
of note - joe is on the commercial side , marcelo parra who is responsible
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made .
regards
andy

as a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable . we need to
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned .
either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of
the people which i do not believe makes any sense at all .
