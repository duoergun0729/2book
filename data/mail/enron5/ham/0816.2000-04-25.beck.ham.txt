hi mary ,
here are the 2 posting forms with your name as dept . manager approver ,
sally ' s name as vp approver and myself as requester to be forwarded to linda
vargo for posting . linda suggested posting the positions internally for 5
days and then posting them externally . although it would be great to get
people on board from within the company , i think we should just get the
postings out everywhere asap .
also , linda required the following questions to be answered :
internal or external posting ? to be posted both internally and externally
are these positions already budgeted ? no , they will have to come from out of
budget
relocations costs to be provided ? relocation costs will be provided for
specialist and above positions but not for clerk , senior clerk positions .
the same also applies for agency fees , ( yes to specialist and above , and no
to clerk / senior clerk ) .
here are the postings to be approved by sally .
thanks ,
avril
