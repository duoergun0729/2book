Subject: confidential folder to safely pass information to arthur andersen
we have become increasingly concerned about confidential information
( dpr / position info , curves , validations / stress tests , etc ) being passed to
arthur andersen for audit purposes over the web to their arthur andersen
email addresses . ( necessary now they no longer have access to enron ' s
internal email system )
please use the folder described below when passing any info ( that you would
have concerns about if it was picked up by a third party ) via the shared
drive that has been set up for this specific purpose .
note : aa should also use the shared drive to pass info back if there are
questions , or the data needs updating . we should also consider the
sensitivity of audit findings and special presentations if they are being
distributed electronically .
please pass this note to others in your groups who have the need to pass info
back and forth .
details on how to access for those who will use this method to pass info :
a secured folder has been set up on the " o " drive under corporate called
arthur _ andersen ( o : \ corporate \ arthur _ anderson ) . please post all confidential
files in this folder rather than emailing the files to their company email
address . if you need access to this folder , submit an erequest through the
it central site : http : / / itcentral . enron . com / data / services / securityrequests / .
arthur andersen will be able to retrieve these files for review with their
terminal server access at the three allen center location .
please contact vanessa schulte if you have any problems or questions
