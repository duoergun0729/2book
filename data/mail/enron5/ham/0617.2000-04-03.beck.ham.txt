as you are probably aware , we are looking at a roll out time for bringing the
international commodities on eol to japan before the end of this month . we
have planned for a public rollout between 10 - 12 may . the mailout for this is
expected to be sent out the third week of april .
as all the products initially posted will be handled through the singapore
books , we need to make sure everything is in line . we will not be offering
any domestic products until probably third quarter . legal has been reviewing
the nature and form of the japanese law and has found that in its current
form we should be able to roll out the system without too much difficulty .
we will be using standard international contract forms which you would expect
the cp ' s in japan to be comfortable with . in addition to your support for
the range of petroleum products , sydney will also quote your usd prices in
yen . i spoke with hickerson last week and they are making preparations for
this . with sydney only 1 hour ahead , this allows shane to provide real time
support throughout the business day in japan .
i would suggest that we have a call in the next day or so to further
discuss . would tomorrow at 2 pm sydney time work ? i believe that this is
noon your time ? if this doesn ' t work let me know so that we can adjust .
thanks ,
joe
