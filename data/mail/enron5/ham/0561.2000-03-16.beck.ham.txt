Subject: mariner
sally and ted ,
brenda , vlady and i met today to discuss project door step for mariner .
since mariner is an e & p company rather than a trading company ( or so we
think ) , i believe our approach may be somewhat different from the other
trading reviews . the review will likely focus on the company ' s risk
management policies and procedures which we think relates mostly to hedging
oil and gas production . based on a review of the last mariner 10 - q ( sept
99 ) , it appears the company does a significant amount of hedging with
financial instruments extending out to 2002 . the company also has
significant ( $ 14 mm ) of deferred losses related to hedging activities .
as discussed with ted , we have preliminary planned to visit mariner on tues .
march 21 . as a starting point , vlady is pulling raroc information related
to mariner and brenda is getting all enron positions with mariner . please
call if you have any questions .
thanks ,
jim
