Subject: continental power
sally ,
i hope that things went well in calgary . i am rapping things up here and i
cannot wait to return home .
my tentative meeting with joe gold for this afternoon has been rescheduled
for 9 : 00 this morning . attached is my assessment of the continental power
operations which i intend to discuss with him . the first page is for joe in
case he would like to keep notes from our discussion and the second page is
more detailed for myself . joe asked that he and i meet privately to discuss
the operations . i ' ve tried to be candid , but yet politically correct .
today i am having lunch with fernly and meeting with the weather commercial
team at 4 : 00 .
i ' ll phone to give you an update ,
todd
