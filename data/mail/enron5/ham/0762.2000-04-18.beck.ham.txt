i did speak with mark and had tim meet with him also . tim and michael sat
together and further discussed the p & l and associated processes . on monday ,
tim accepted the position and i informed sally , but obviously did not give
you the update .
when i return , tentatively may 15 , i would like to get a copy of the resumes
which you have and will post the position again . thank you for holding
things together and after tim has 2 - 3 weeks with michael , he should be able
to move to structuring .
pencil in lunch for that tuesday or wednesday that i return ,
todd

i haven ' t heard from you lately . understand you spoke directly to mark
tawney . i assume tim norton is a go for replacing michael nguyen as risk
book administrator for weather on a full time basis . i plan to withdraw the
job posting from the board .
