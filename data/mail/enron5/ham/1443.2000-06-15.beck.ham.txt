Subject: re : doorstep meeting - additional action steps
mike - thanks i got it eventually .
the only thing i would add at this stage would be under " daily management p & l
and position reporting . . . "
" key positional and valuation data delivered to corporate risk aggregation
system ( " risktrac " ) by a pre - determined time "
the form and content of that data i outlined in my last tome .
this will allow us to ( amongst other things ) get the positions aggregated and
perform some level of assessment , and allow you folks to kill the spreadsheet
you currently use to calculate var , because risktrac has the var engine .
