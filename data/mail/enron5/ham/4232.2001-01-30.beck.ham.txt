okay - i would advise this though : since we may all be spending $ $ on a
trip on nov . as well , i think we can be a bit judicious about what we do in
june . i don ' t think we need to do anything on the order that we did it 10
years ago . . . i ' ll be thinking of some restaurant ideas as well .
i tell you what might be nice : jeffrey ' s has a private dining area ( think
called josephine ' s house ) - we had crockett int . christmas there last year -
and sally had some enron doo there - i think we could decorate it a bit and
it would be quite nice . - c .
