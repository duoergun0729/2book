subject : re : doorstep meeting
cassandra ,
i think michael ' s issue is just one for you and shona to worry about and try
to simultaneously come up with a way to diffuse without bastardizing the
process . . i continue to say the we need to maintain the theme that speed
and " gut reaction " is preferable to consensus and prosecutable evidence , i
feel so strongly about this that i would consider removing my team from
involvement if politically correct , grammatically sound and properly
researched reports that do not say anything or are stale or are full of
ambiguity are the end result ( see the internal audit report on
! ! ! ) . i think the solution is make it clear that these reports are not to
be used for prosecution but frank discussion .
i am right about this .
please forward this to shona / sally / mike or anyone else at your discretion
( this is a compromise between evil ted and zen ted )
