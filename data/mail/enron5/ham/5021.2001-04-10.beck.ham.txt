please plan to attend a meeting with brian redmond and bob hall on thursday at 4 : 00 in conference room 3567 .
each person should be prepared to discuss the current status of each " bad debt " account that was assigned to them in february .
if you are unable to attend you will need to schedule a private meeting with brian redmond at a later date .
