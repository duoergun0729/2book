subject : metals - imminent actions - an update
rick / rick / sally
i attach the ' executive ' summary of a note sent to the office of the chair
last week detailing current operational difficulties with the metals
merchanting business . subsequently an ' all hands ' meeting was called to
discuss the operational issues and the business imperatives of
off balance sheet facility ( " obsf " ) renegotiation
minimising working captial
sap implementation
the notes of that meeting are also attached at the bottom of this email
should you require any further information please call , otherwise i will
forward updates as they are completed .
regards
mike
issue
the physical metals business implemented an off balance sheet structure
( obsf ) pre year - end to meet enron requirements for gearing ratios .
whilst this does not present undue problems for lme warrants , these being
bearer documents , it does present an issue when physical metal , the value of
which depends upon brand and location , is placed into the facility . given the
hard deadline of year - end the operational support of this process initially
took place on spreadsheets .
the impact of the obsf on the operational side of the physical business
should not be underestimated . the process of moving material off and on
balance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlements ,
particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in
the as 400 . with the specified functionality it is believed that all
operational and trading issues arising from obsf can be managed
satisfactorily .
the core functionality , which was due prior to the year - end , was released
during january but was subsequently found to have introduced  + bugs  , to the
integrated business control processes . whilst an improvement on having no
obsf functionality , the  + bugs  , have had an increasingly negative effect on
the control environment , compounded by the fact that it can not provide a
guaranteed delivery for the  + bug  , fixes and non core  , reporting  ,
functionality .
this has given rise to the following concerns :
? there are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at a
brand & location level to coordination records ( the global position is
reconciled however ) .
? it is not possible to substantiate the dpr for em & cl as :
? a ) p & l on spread moves from cash to 3 months positions ( and related cash to
3 months provisions ) can not be produced by the system and must be estimated ,
and
? b ) system bugs have created uncertainties over trial balance values .
these concerns are compounded by the following :
? the most experienced as 400 it developer for the em & cl business has
resigned . he is currently working his 6 months notice which will expire in
july 2001 .
? the most experienced as 400 it developer on the eml side of the business has
also resigned . he left in january 2001 .
? there is no documentation for the as 400 . it is therefore difficult for
experienced as 400 programmers to get upto speed on the system .
conclusion
it is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of the
as 400 system and the renegotiation of the obsf facility with barclays . the
current situation has arisen due to non - delivery of it developments and tight
timescales on the finalisation of the obsf facility .
to meet ql end requirements ( i . e . full production of the dpr and stock
reconciliation ) , it and the obsf deal team must make concrete commitments on
delivery timeline . the business will not be able to commit to successful
implementation of the facility and resubstantiation of the trial balance
without these
