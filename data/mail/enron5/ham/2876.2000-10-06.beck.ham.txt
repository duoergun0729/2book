debbie ,
for uk power , this was not officialised because we had a curve shift for 25 +
years which was made in error . for the dpr we put a ' top side ' adjustment
through but because of the time it would take to re calc no re calc was
performed . this should have been covered in the daily conference call . was it
?
for uk gas , i thought this issue was closed on the conference call . we used
the 30 th as our month end as a result of the way the month end fell . the guys
have now clicked the ' officialised ' button for the 29 th if it helps you , but
we did not use that data ( there shouldn ' t be anything materially wrong with
it though ) .
what i think this highlights is that we will have days where we do not
officialise and do not re run . in these circumstances we will put a top side
through . we therefore need a mechanism to communicate this top side and i
would request we get this in place as soon as possible ( this has been
requested a few times before ) .
does this answer your questions ?

james ,
just received a note fron steve price that uk power was never approved for
close of business 02 - oct . can you or someone in your group respond to that as
well as to my query as to the lack of approval for uk gas for close of
business on 29 - sep ? ( see below )
we are making a real effort here to understand why the risk controls groups
are not receiving data on a reliable basis and input from your group is
crucial .
thanks for your help ,
debbie

debbie ,
there is an mtm for the 29 - sep but is has not been approved . however , there
is also an mtm for 30 - sep which has been approved . i think the risk managers
would have the answer to why .
