Subject: data integrity partnership
all of us on your hr team want to thank you for your quick response to the
data integrity needs in sally ' s organisation . we received 122 changes
which are being forwarded for input as we speak . your co - operation and
willingness to help us maintain data integrity will be essential to the
success of this effort . all of us appreciate your contributions to this
effort .
i think that this will also be a good time to re - cap what we agreed to do
going forward .
we will forward a friendly reminder to receive any data or organisational
changes that have occurred during the week by friday afternoon .
we will forward bi - weekly reports to you and monthly reports to sally ' s
direct reports to verify that the data is correct .
sally will receive a recap of the correct data on a monthly basis .
we will attend your admin . meetings for the first 15 minutes to exchange
information as needed .
we will switch from bi - weekly data checks to monthly data checks as the
number of needed corrections decreases . we will focus on new admins . to
help them comb through their department ' s data .
thank you for your co - operation ,
your hr team
