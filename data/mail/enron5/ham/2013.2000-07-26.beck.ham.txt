long with around 5 people per session . there is one overview class , design
& data flow , which will not be hands on but which will give you an overview
of how data flows in the systems . each class will focus on how to pull
reports within the specific module listed and how to use the standard sap
reporting tools .
please review the list of classes below and provide me with a list of
individuals that you would like to attend each type of session and your first
