subject : executive reports viewer
in an effort to maintain the integrity of the sensitive reports of ena , and
therefore , minimize access to this information , permissions to the executive
reports viewer were recently reviewed by john lavorato , and his revisions
were made accordingly .
if you have any questions or comments , please contact me at 3 - 9307 or kristin
walsh at 3 - 9510 .
thank you ,
