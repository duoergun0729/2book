hi , sistas -
here ' s the scoop on the josephine house :
we can reserve with just a credit card ; no deposit required .
parties under 20 : $ 200 room fee . $ 50 valet parking fee .
i confirmed " 17 " with mom .
heidi sent some sample menus . a 3 - course menu ( appetizer or salad , entree ,
dessert ) is $ 45 .
a 4 - course ( same as 3 - course plus hors d ' oeuvres ) sample menu is $ 52 .
each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course . the
food sounds really good .
so , here ' s a guess at cost :
17 people at $ 45 = $ 765
beverages = $ 200
gratuity = $ 193
valet = $ 50
room rental = $ 200
total $ 1408 , or $ 469 per family if we divide it into
thirds
what do you guys think ? should we explore other options - or just go with
this ? i think chris and i would be fine with this sort of cost - but
probably couldn ' t go crazy with gift and decorations too . so , if we really
want to do the photo ( s ) - do we have a cost for these yet ? , we may want to
consider other options . thoughts ? - cara
