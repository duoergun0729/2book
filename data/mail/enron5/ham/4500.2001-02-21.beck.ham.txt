joel has been negotiating with open text along with ryan orsak - as enron has
been providing numerous resource hours testing their ' beta ' product that
integrates livelink with irims for records management processes . our
experience has been that we are finding way too many problems and that the
product does not function as ' advertised ' . therefore , joel sought a credit
to reimburse enron for the value of the testing we have performed for them .
the $ 30 , 000 software credit will likely be used to purchase the web front end
to the livelink product .
congratulations , joel !

mary , i am happy to say open text has agreed to a $ 60 , 000 credit for enron .
enron will receive this credit via $ 30 , 000 in software and $ 30 , 000 credit in
professional services .
