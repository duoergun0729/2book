Subject: clcikpaper cost per trade
as requested , i have come up with a rough estimate of the cost per trade for
clickpaper ( from a product control group / call center prospective only ) .
the average cost per month for the team ( fully loaded - salaries , benefits ,
plus expenses ) is $ 36 , 000 . the average number of trades per month is 40 -
therefore , the average cost $ 900 per trade .
as a comparison , the average cost per enrononline trade $ 3 . 00 . as you can
see , it is much lower due to the volume of transactions . we will recognize
the same economies of scale when the clickpaper trades increase . we do not
anticipate needing any additional staff this year .
please let me know if you have any questions .
