Subject: re : lng
the only conversation i have had with jeff regarding this topic was when i
was in houston and he had inquired as to when i was returning , stating that
he was going to need some help in integrating another business within gas
trading ( and alluded to the possibility of it being liquids related ) . my
thoughts are that it would need to be supported out of my group since it is
going to roll up to jeff . do you want me to set up a conference call with
you , scott earnest and myself to discuss ? subsequent to that we should
probably have a conference call with jeff to get specifics . let me know what
i need to do on this .

scott earnest announced in the staff meeting today that in a meeting he had
earlier today with jeff shankman and vince kaminiski that jeff announced that
he had gotten the nod from mark frevert to manage the lng book of business .
( this sentence structure is bad , but you get the drift . ) that is probably
what shankman has alluded to in terms of increased responsibility . i will
assume that is in addition to gas , but i don ' t know that for sure .
scott has been working on setting up the risk books for lng , working closely
over the last several weeks with vince kaminski . we need to talk about this
business and the best way to support it . have you had any conversations with
jeff on this ?
