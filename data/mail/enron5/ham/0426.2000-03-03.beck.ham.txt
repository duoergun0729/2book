Subject: japanese regulatory environment
in the west , the relationship between regulators and businesses is based on
control ( and sometimes conflict - - somewhat like prison guard vs . inmates ) .
nevertheless , in japan , it has until recently been based on cooperation ( more
like a coach and team ) .
the japanese understand that this relationship may not be the best for the
nation as a whole and have begun changing it . this process is disconcerting
and has powerful emotions attached to it .
i thought you might find this article interesting , since it shows some of the
complexities inherent in this change that might not be readily apparent to
westerners .
