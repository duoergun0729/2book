Subject: we need to run a little project over the next week or so .
i think it is time that you have someone inventory all the projects you have going in your group , sit down and go over them with me and then you and i make sure they still have support from a business unit or make sense at all . some of them involve it resources and some don ' t .
i just want to take a breath for a moment and make sure every project you are doing ( outside the daily operations that are so critical ) is necessary and still has a sponsor at a business unit . if not , we can stop several side projects and focus on the critical ones , save some money and make sure we get the 5 to 10 things that absolutely have to be done completed .
your thoughts ?
