i believe that troy klussman had contacted many of you to get this process
rolling but i just wanted to reiterate that we need to get this done as
quickly as possible . the questions about eol revenues and volumes are really
starting to roll in . troy will continue to follow up on the ena front and i
will be checking up on london and global liquids . please call us with any
questions . i have attached a file created by bob shults that shows 1999
revenues by product for use as a reasonableness check . bob can provide more
detail if you need it

jason ,
we are looking for a way to extract enron on - line revenues and sales volumes
out of your regular upstream invoicing system that presumably feeds sap .
for the first quarter of 2000 ( and thereafter ) enron corp . in seriously
contemplating disclosing in press releases , eol volumes and revenues separate
from traditional volumes and revenues . they need to be able to get these
numbers out of our regular accounting records . the numbers that the eol team
calculates out of their systems ( which is not a financial system ) can be used
to verify that the accounting numbers are being extracted correctly .
currently for ena , the eol trade system feeds sitara ( deal capture ) and
passes over an eol deal number . sitara assigns it ' s own deal number but
passes both numbers when it feeds our settlement & logistics system ( unify ) .
unify currently feeds our general ledger but it is not set up to book based
upon the eol tag , we are designing that into our sap design . in the
meantime , we will query unify and extract the portion of unify revenues and
volumes that are eol . we will then book a reclass into hyperion to separate
eol revenues from traditional revenues . we are currently using numbers
provided by bob shults for 1999 to verify that everything is working
correctly . we are finding valid timing differences due to assumptions that
bob is making .
unfortunately , a few of the products that are being traded or will be traded
on eol do not feed into settlement systems like unify but rather are invoiced
manually . we are having to identify a way to accurately capture those
numbers as well , so that they can also be reclassified in hyperion .
this project has a pretty short fuse as there is much outside interest in eol
and thus a great need to be able to accurately calculate sales revenues and
sales volumes .
please call me with any questions that you have and keep me updated on your
progress .

hi georgeanne ,
donnah mentioned that bob shults has the statistical information you required
for london eol transactions but you require more supporting documentation to
back them up .
would you be able to send me the reports and let me know the information you
are looking for . i will then be able to ask around the relevant people and
see what we can dig out for you .
thanks ,
jason
