the companies that are our primary competition in this area are the big 5
accounting firms . they interview in may of a 5 year ppa ' s 3 rd year for a
spring internship in the 4 th year . we must attract 4 th year ppas in the fall
before their spring internship or 3 rd year ppas in the spring . we need to do
alot more planning on this between now and next fall but i definitely want to
interview for interns both in the spring and fall . thanks

lexi :
all of the companies that you mentioned interview for internships during
spring ( february ) recruiting . fall is primarily when these companies
come for full time recruiting .

lynett and cindy :
greetings from houston !
i have a special request for you . in order for us to prepare our campus
recruiting strategy for next fall , i need information regarding
internship
recruiting .
as you know , we decided to concentrate our spring 2001 effort on intern
recruiting and interviewing . in order for us to ensure that we are
being
effective with this strategy , i need to know which companies interviewed
for summer interns during the fall 2000 recruiting season . companies of
particular interest would be el paso , williams , dynegy , duke , consulting
firms such as mckinsey , and big 5 accounting firms .
by providing this information , you would greatly assist our effort for
upcoming years .
thank you in advance for your assistance .
sincerely ,
lexi elliott
