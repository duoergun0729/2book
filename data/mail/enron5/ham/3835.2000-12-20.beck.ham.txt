Subject: re : new counterparty
we have zeroed out the mark to market value in the spreadsheets . now there
still is " new counterparty " in the spreadsheet , but there is $ 0 in credit
risk for those . john powell in debbie ' s group is working on a longer term
solution , but everyone is comfortable with this for now .

subject : new counterparty
we have figured out why the credit group is getting so many " new
counterparty " names in gas . the spreadsheets that they are getting that
information from are for position purposes only on pipe - optons . the value is
captured in tagg and therefore if both had the correct counterparty it would
be doublecounting credit risk . the spreadsheet download has a specific
download that it has to follow which includes counterparty name ( which in
this case had to be put in as new counterparty . ) i am working with debbie to
figure out how we can download those positions without showing a counterparty
at all from the spreadsheet . it will be done as quickly as possible .
thanks
