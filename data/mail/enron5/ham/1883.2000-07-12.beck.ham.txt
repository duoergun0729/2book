Subject: follow up on india
as a follow up to my message yesterday , i have talked to george mcclellan who
assured me that he is taking things in india slowly and that no coal
transactions will be taking place in the near term .
i also talked to bill bradford who has been in discussions with the office
regarding counterparty credit . however , nothing has been formalized .
