Subject: re : data exchange strategy
thanks for the slides . there really is nothing new under the sun . the key
is to identify the source of competitive advantage . to my mind it ' s the same
line of thought that leads us to see eol as sustainable , but neutral b 2 b
marketplaces as temporary . our only competitive advantage is that we are the
largest principal member of the potential club , making our participation most
critical . given this , our timing and positioning relative to potentially
joining others may be the single most important strategic decision we make .
i would enjoy hearing your thoughts on any other elements of competitve
advantage that we could leverage , particularly those elements that are most
sustainable .

subject : data exchange strategy
i just saw this presentation on envera and couldn ' t help but think this is
the concept you were promoting yesterday as a data hub / exchange . seems like
that is the envera strategy as well .
