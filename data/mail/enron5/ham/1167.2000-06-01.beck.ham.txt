Subject: japan trading
i just wanted to touch base with you regarding trading operations in japan .
during the call today , it sounds like eol in japan may be near up and
running . i was wondering if we could discuss what type of plans you have for
a mid and back office function . i ' d like to get in the loop and help set
controls and procedures up as soon as possible . i have a meeting with
jan - erland late next week , but if there is anything that needs to be started
before then , please let me know .
regards
shona
