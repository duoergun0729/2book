Subject: india
dear bill ,
i am currently helping milind laad and heidi hellman establish a risk
operations department for the india trading company . i was wondering if you
would have 10 minutes to meet with me sometime this week to discuss how you
see india moving forward and in what time frame as this would help me a great
deal in determining what types of systems , processes , and controls we should
set up .
thanks ,
shona
