Subject: floor space planning - staff meeting item for monday
sally plans to discuss floor space with greg whalley as early as monday of
next week . i want to be sure that we do not shortchange ourselves on the
number of spaces we need by floor . the origination group is very interested
in occupying space on level 30 and the only way that can happen is if we
relocate essential people closer to the power and gas commercial teams on 31
and 32 .
sally plans to confirm the number of spaces we need on each floor for energy
operations in her staff meeting on monday . please be prepared to discuss
your numbers at that time . i will bring a spreadsheet summarizing the
information to the staff meeting .
if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to call me . thank you in
advance for your help .
