please join me in congratulating paul quilkey in his new role as vice
president leading our efforts in australia . joe hirl has assumed a leading
role in the formation of our business in japan . joe also has regional
responsibility for trading activity .
paul ' s appointment is in recognition of the critical role paul has played in
enron australia ' s successful commencement and the body of outstanding work he
has accumulated to date in his career with enron . it is worth noting that
paul joined enron as recently as the associate intake of 1995 . in the short
time since then paul has developed and grown through various positions to his
current trading and origination role , a position of great responsibility in a
dynamic young business making aggressive inroads into the australian market ,
