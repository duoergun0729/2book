subject : congratulations
i asked mike this week if your baby was here , and he said that you had just
returned to the office . congratulations on the birth of your little girl . i
hope that all three of you are surviving those first few weeks of adjustment
and that sleep is not too short a commodity in your house ! i will look
forward to seeing pictures of lauren when i am next in london . you do know
that now that you are a dad that it is a requirement to be armed with
adorable pictures at all times ? !
