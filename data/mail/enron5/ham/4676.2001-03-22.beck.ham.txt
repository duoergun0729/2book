Subject: contacts for commodity logic
during my meeting with kathryn cordes the other day , i mentioned to her that i was having lunch with mirant ( formerly southern company energy mktg . ) and wanted to know the status of any contact that tom gros may have had with them so that i would know how to handle my discussions with them . early on , we had asked that commoditylogic target companies like aep and mirant for confirmlogic . kathryn mentioned that they were also thinking of talking to el paso .
tom called me yesterday and asked for a contact name at el paso . i told him about my planned lunch with mirant as well . he asked me to get a contact name for mirant as well .
i received some information from mirant today that actually helps our case for confirmlogic . they informed me that they have just visited with aep regarding deals transacted on the intercontinental power exchange ( ice ) platform ( mirant is a stakeholder in that trading platform ) . aep wants to eliminate confirmations for trades on that platform and want the automatch function . he said that aep ' s it dept . is ready to take that step . he also made the comment that mirant ' s it dept . is very lacking and is not ready to perform the automatch function . he did say that they would be receptive to verifying the deal information electronically and eliminating the confirmations . he felt that technology wise , they were 3 years behind where we are .
our advantage is that we want to automatch the entire universe of deals ( broker , eol , direct trades , trades done on other platforms ( i . e . dynegy direct , ice , etc . ) ) rather than just a subset of deals ( i . e . trades done on ice as aep suggested ) .
just want to pass this on to you to see if you had any concerns about providing this information to tom . i was planning on sending him an email tomorrow to give him the contact information . let me know .
