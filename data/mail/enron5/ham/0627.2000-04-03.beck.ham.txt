sally ,
i tried to get on your calendar but you are busy this week so i decide to
send you a very important e - mail . you told me to contact you if i was ever
considering leaving my current job so i am doing so at this time . i want to
say that i have thoroughly enjoyed working with you and you are the most
impressive employee at enron at any level . i feel comfortable speaking with
you and appreciate all of your advice . i am not totally unhappy with the
recruiting part of my job , i just feel that i do not " buy into " everything
that is happening in my group . there are many necessary changes that are
needed and i feel that the program is heading in an excellent direction . i
just want to get into more of a sales oriented part of enron because i feel
that my strength is selling . i would like to at least get an interview with
enron broadband because i know that they are filling up there retail sales
groups . although i do not have all the technical experience , i know people
who have gone over there with no technical or no sales experience . as you
know , it is who you know and i do not have a relationship with david cox or
any of the
retail folks in broadband . i was hoping that you would give david a call and
see if he could at least give me an interview in one of the retail groups .
brent has called over to david and i feel if you were to call also , it would
help .
sally , let me know if this will be ok and i would like to get on your
calendar to discuss further . nobody in my group knows that i am looking for
another job so please keep this confidential . i can not tell how much i
value your opinion and advice in matters especially like these . thank you so
much and i look forward
to hearing from you soon .
