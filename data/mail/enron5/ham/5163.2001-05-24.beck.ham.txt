Subject: since it is prc time
after all of the chaos and discontent over the aep / hpl situation , i thought i would convey some first hand comment in regard to bob hall . every person that has spoken to me about the aep / hpl situation , has had nothing but praise for the fair and compassionate way that bob has dealt with some very difficult situations . through my personal observations , i know that he has also done a great job of keeping the ultimate goal of a june closing on track , in the face of huge obstacles .
since this is prc time , i thought i would share this with you .
if you have any questions or would like some more particulars , please feel to give me a call at x 36674 or shoot me an email .
