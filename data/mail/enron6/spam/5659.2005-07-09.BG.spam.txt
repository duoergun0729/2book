how can you sell this software as oem ? it seems too good to be true - is there a catch ?
there is no catch - the software versions that we sell are oem ( original equipment manufacturer )
which means you will receive the installation cds only ( they do not come in their original retail
packing and do not include the manual ) . we do guarantee that all programs are the 100 % full working
retail versions - no demos or academic versions ! when you order , you will receive all materials
required for a complete installation - or your money back ! why pay hundreds of dollars more when you
can get exactly the same but oem - cd ? you don ' t have to pay that much for the fancy box and manuals .
why is your software so inexpensive compared to the other retailers ?
we minimize our overhead by stocking mostly top selling software only and try to get the
best deals for them . we also sell what are called oem versions , the same software as the
box version without the box and the manual . by foregoing the fancy box and typically slim
manuals you end up saving a considerable amount .
