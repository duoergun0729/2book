hello ,
we sent you an email a while ago , because you now qualify
for a much lower rate based on the biggest rate drop in years .
you can now get $ 327 , 000 for as little as $ 617 a month !
bad credit ? doesn ' t matter , low rates are fixed no matter what !
follow this link to process your application and a 24 hour approval :
