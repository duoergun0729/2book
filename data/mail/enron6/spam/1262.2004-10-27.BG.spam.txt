Subject: are you with me ? ? ?
dear sir / madam ,
i am michael a . williams ( esq ) , solicitor with the nigerian aviation
ministry ( n . a . m ) .
on the 10 th day of july , 2003 , an engineer expatriate working as a at the n . m . a lost his life on his way to lagos from abuja by a fatal motor accident , along with his wife and children who later gave up at the general hospital .
before his death , the deceased has a deposit with a financial
institution here worth fourteen million five hundred thousand united states dollars ( 14 , 500 , 000 ) .
as his personal attorney and since i am the only one who knows about the deposit , i went to the financial institution to make the claim and was told that the only person who can claim this money is his next of kin .
since all his family died at the accident , all effort to trace his next of kin proved abortive . therefore , i am writing to you so that i can make you the deceased next of kin , as the security company also told me that immediatelyi present the deceased next of kin , the money would be released
to the person within few working days . be informed that your gratification for assistingme to claim this money shall be 50 % ; while the remaining 50 % shall be
mine .
in my next e - mail , i shall give you detail explanation on how the project will be executed . meanwhile , acknowledge the receipt of this mail immediately and include your personal and direct telephone / fax numbers for easy communication .
yours sincerely
michael a . williams
