low load reservation gri changes from . 0550 to . 0407

marketers :
as the attached letter explains , i have redetermined which shippers are considered " low load " for the coming year .
the changes from low to high or high to low are listed in the letter . a few customers flip - flop from year to year . if any of your customers are affected , please advise them before january reservation invoices go out ( february 1 , 2002 ) . nng files a tariff change for the new rates , but does not file or mail out any notices about changes in a shipper ' s high / low load status .
john williams / gas logistics - fyi . the spreadsheet lists legal entities that are in the high load or low load categories for 2002 .
if a shipper is not listed , then it will default to the high load gri rate .
call if you have questions .
