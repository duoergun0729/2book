Subject: north baja project
according to jeff dasovich , the ceo of sempra has referred to the project
publicly as a " bypass pipeline . " the pipe will drop down through imperial
irrigation , follow the border on the mexico side , go through mexicali and
serve the new sempra ldc there , go back across the border to south of san
diego to the pg & e ' s otay mesa ipp , then proceed on to rosarita .
as we discussed , the " genie is out of the bottle " with respect to all future
bypass projects in california . the only significant opposition that could be
mounted here is the cpuc and / or other customer groups like turn or ora
bemoaning the project ' s " cherrypicking " of gas loads .
