glen , i thought i pass this tidbit of information on to you and the enron
team . i was speaking to a pg & e manager yesterday attempting to get an update
of where pg & e thinks it stands on it open season application . bottom line
this individual had just received word a few minutes before that
commissioner bilas was writing a proposed decision that would " deny " pg & e ' s
application . therefore , pg & e ' s open season would be closed down . i will
follow up next week .
on another important initiative , pg & e ' s gas accord ii , apparently pg & e ' s
long awaited application is still hung up with the bankruptcy attorneys .
given their chapter 11 status , i am sure that their application which
includes spending hundreds of millions of dollars for system upgrades
requires review and preliminary approval from the bankruptcy attorneys and
eventually the judge . i will keep you posted .
