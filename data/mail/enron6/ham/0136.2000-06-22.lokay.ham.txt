Subject: reimbursement of individually billed items
the use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past few
years . as a result the accounts payable department has seen a rapid increase
in the number of invoices and vendors . with the higher volume , we have
reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle .
although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual
employees , they often mail invoices directly to accounts payable . at times
they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone . in these
cases we return the invoice to the vendor . if the employee is designated , we
try to track him / her down and forward the invoice . the high level of
employee movement among jobs and locations at enron has made this
increasingly challenging . either way , we end up doing something less
productive than paying invoices .
to maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessary
for research , we request that employees who have pagers , cell phones , and
other individually billed items such as licenses , subscriptions , etc . , pay
for them by personal check or charge card ( if applicable  * payment instructions
are usually indicated on the invoice ) and request reimbursement through
employee expense reports .
by submitting these charges on your expense report , you can help us reduce
the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices , the number of
checks generated by treasury , the number of vendors in our database , and the
turnaround time for payment of invoices .
