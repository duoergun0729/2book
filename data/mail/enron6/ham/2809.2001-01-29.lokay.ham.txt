michelle sent me the attached ( different version ) this morning for approval
where she changed the first paragraph . i ' ve reviewed the original version
susan scott just sent as well . it appears that most of the changes were just
spelling out " transwestern . " i am ok with both versions as long as we have
the july , 2000 date correct . please send me the final version that goes out
for my records .

michelle , as i mentioned in my voice mail , the other lawyers wanted a few
changes . my sincerest apologies for the confusion . apparently you and i
were actually working off an old version of fgt ' s letter , not the one they
ultimately approved and used . since you are out of the office , i ' ve taken
the liberty of forwarding it to carl without you reviewing it first , since i
know we want to mail this out soon .
carl , michelle advised me that eol ' s lawyer had approved the previous version
so i assume they will want to review this one as well . let me know if there
are any concerns .
thanks !
