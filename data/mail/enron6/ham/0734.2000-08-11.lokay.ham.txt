Subject: 2000 chairman ' s award
everyday heroes are all around us at enron , living our core values of
respect , integrity , communication and excellence in everything they do . some
of these heroes make a big splash while others just quietly make a difference
in the workplace around them . either way , these special individuals deserve
to be recognized with a nomination for the 2000 chairman ' s award .

award program will honor 10 employees as members of the chairman ' s
roundtable . from that group , the one individual most embodying our values
will be presented with the chairman ' s award at the management conference in
san antonio in november .

from beginning to end . from your nominations , an international employee
committee will select the chairman ' s roundtable and eventually , the
chairman ' s award winner . your role of nominating our everyday heroes is
extremely vital to the program ' s success . if someone has made a positive
