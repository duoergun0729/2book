Subject: wefa report on future of gas turbines for power
note : wefa has made some interesting points in their conclusions of this
study .
gas turbines headed for a 50 % meltdown
high natural gas prices , performance issues and higher than expected
maintenance costs , a general economic slowdown and several other key factors
will combine to create a " near - term meltdown in the gas turbine market , "
according to a report by wefa , inc .
reporting on a study about to be published by the analysis and consulting
firm based in eddystone , pa , one of its authors predicted " a substantial
short - term correction in the gas turbine market . . which could render 50 % of
current north american projects uneconomic . " jason makansi , principal of

fuel - switching is not living up to its advance billing ; units may not perform
as well at high ambient temperatures ; overhauls are required more frequently
than had been expected ; maintenance costs also are exceeding expectations ;
and fuel quality is becoming an issue .
