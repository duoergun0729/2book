is their anything i can do ? i am sitting in the upper midwest and could go see any of these clients if it would help . people ' s will be reviewing their situation every 3 - 4 days . tom came out strong for us , dick continues to be the conservative and concerned one . i still believe a call from you to dick is merited . his direct number is 312 / 240 - 4300 .
let me help you where i can . hope your holding up . . .
