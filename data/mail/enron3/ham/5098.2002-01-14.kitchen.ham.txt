hey penny
need your help urgently to pull together a short one or two pager for
us to present to the business first thing tomorrow . the one urgent
issue that has not yet been resolved in regards to migration of enron
systems is the domain name and how we direct traffic to the site . jim
has registered the domain names below , in the absence of any direction
from the business .
to give a bit of context , the site will contain power & gas trading and
third party feeds . it will not have any intermingled content with the
rest of client portal . it will have its own electronic client
contracts and disclaimers . it will have a distinct team responsible
for allocating client passwords , assigning entitlements , ehelp , etc .
so in summary the whole site will be run and managed completely
separately from rest of corp kiss , judit
