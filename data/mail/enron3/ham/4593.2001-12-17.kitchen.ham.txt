Subject: broker client deals
louise ,
i don ' t think we have much value in assigning the broker client deals . most contracts have automatically terminated or have been terminated by the brokers on account of not having access to the submission screens .
there is very little outstanding money left in these contracts , anyway - most of them have monthly payments and those which do not are paid to only ql 2002 , anyway .
therefore , i think there is little value in pursuing assignment of these and i recommend we instead pursue new contracts ( at the appropriate time ) , perhaps with the first few months free to soothe any bad feelings on their part .
do you agree ?
