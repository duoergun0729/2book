steve sent you a breifing on the vitro plant , in case the topic comes up :
the following is a brief bullet point description of the monterrey cogeneration plant to incorporate intom the information you are send louise in preparation for the conference tomorrow .
* 245 mw cogeneration facility located in garcia , nuevo leon ( about 20 miles west of monterrey ) .
* natural gas fired ge 7 fa gas turbine is the anchor piece of equipment used at the facility .
* commercial operations set for october 31 , 2002 .
* power purchasers are vitro ( 110 mw ) , imsa ( 90 mw ) , and apasco ( 40 mw ) under 15 year ppas .
* vitro subsidiary alcali to be supplied 210 tons per hour of steam under a 15 year spa .
* transmission and distribution of the electricity to be provided by the cfe .
* natural gas to be provided by pgpb ( pemex ) .
* financing provided by the inter - american development bank .
* major equipment foundations have been completed at the construction site , and equipment is beginning to be placed on the foundations .
* the offtakers of energy from this plant are expected to save over us $ 400 mm over the term of the 15 year agreements
a couple of other things to note are to the extent the project comes up , all enron people should refer to the project as the monterrey cogeneration plant and not the vitro plant so as not to diminish imsa and apasco , and to the extent we are questioned on the sell - down of the equity the response there is that initiative , while not finalized , is being pursued to manage enron ' s balance sheet and that enron will continue to maintain a significant equity interest in the facility .
