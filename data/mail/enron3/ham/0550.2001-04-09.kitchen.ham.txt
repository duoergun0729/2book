no this is definitely not the final document . . issues 1 - 3 are correct and complete , but 4 & 5 are not .
i imagine 6 - 10 pages in reporting requirements for gas daily options and pipe options alone .
while we are still working on these requirements we can move forward on 1 - 3 and the deal entry and new deal type
for basis options .
