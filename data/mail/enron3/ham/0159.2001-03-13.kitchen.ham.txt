subject : gary hickerson ' s group
believe it or not - i am still finalizing the individual plans for each of hte enron americas . i notice we are currently picking up all 19 people from gary hickerson ' s group which i presume is a mistake . i assume we will get some form of allocation based on the work he does for ena but probably not $ 11 . 64 million / annum . i am going to let the accounts team know there is an issue but could one of you let me know who is responsible for the plans in your group .
just thought i ' d check that i wasn ' t missing something .
thanks
