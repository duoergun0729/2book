louise ,
are we ok to go forward on neil ? last time we talked you seemed ok with internal transfers as long as there was no increase in pay or title . not sure on the relocations from london in light of the current situation . may want to hold on them until things settle down and we know the impact on the houston staffing . my guess is that we will have a lot of very strong people in houston available .
thanks ,
robert

can you confirm whether we have put a hold on all internal transfers . i heard this but wanted to confirm . i have been approached by several very dtrong people in other groups and i do think we need to address how we handle in light of any potential upcoming reductions .
specifically , there is one individual still in broadband , neil carpino , that everyone would like to have join berney / edith / terry . there are two individuals in europe , posey martinez and elizabeth johnston that would be good fits as well . i am holding off on all moves until there is more clarity .
any info or insight you might provide would be helpful .
thanks ,
