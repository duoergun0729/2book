Subject: carlos alatorre
louise ,
carlos has informed me that he has been told he will likely be laid off .
you may wish to consider intervening to keep him :
- if the new purchaser is interested in the texmex concept , carlos is the most important mexican link . he has great relationships , has negotiated mou ' s and is close to contract with multiple customers .
- if we desire to retain enrononline expertise , carlos has it .
- he is still on the us payroll and has an enron working visa .
