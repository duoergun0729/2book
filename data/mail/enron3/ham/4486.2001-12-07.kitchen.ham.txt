Subject: severance for ena lay - off ' s
michelle ,
as discussed we are planning 200 lay - off ' s in ena effective dec 15 . can you confirm that the $ 4500 payment is applicable to them , on account of warn , accrued vacation , etc . , if it does presumably we will pay within 7 days of dec 15 .
i am getting a lot of questions and at this stage and simply send we will " confirm it ' s applicability in next few days " .
