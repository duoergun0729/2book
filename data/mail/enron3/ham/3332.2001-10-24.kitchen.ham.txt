enclosed you will please find the 2002 plan which has been revised for expenses .
the indirects have increased based upon known allocations . additionally , the increase is related to the fact that it had been incorrectly capitalizing most of the development support in 2001 until 3 rd quarter when we started reversing the capitalization .

enclosed you will please find the 2002 margin and expense plan related to your estimated cash flows for 2002 .
cash flows were based on the current book and subsequent monthly liquidations over 2002 . to this average monthly balance , we added the average monthly increase in gross book balance which has been provided by your group .
drift numbers have decreased considerably from 2000 due to decreased interest rates . please advise if you would like us to update this schedule for any changes to your new business estimate for 2002 .
please feel free to call me or clara if you have any questions .
