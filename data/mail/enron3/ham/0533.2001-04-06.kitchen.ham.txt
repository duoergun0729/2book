Subject: re : allegheny closing
thanks for the note . the concern was not over the timing of the receipt of funds but rather a comment which implied that allegheny needed to raise the funds through an equity offering . is that a fair characterization and , if so , do you have any concerns over allegheny ' s short term access to capital ( i . e . what is their funding strategy if the equity markets continue to be rocky ) . my concern is heightened by the bankruptcy filing of pcg which will most likely create a fair amount of volatility through the utility sector .
i appreciate your thoughts .
thanks ,

ben ,
i have heard through the grape vine that concerns were raised this morning at your staff meeting about the allegheny closing . just to clarify , we have set may 3 , 2001 as the closing date . on that date we should receive $ 1 , 028 , 000 . 00 plus $ 10 - 15 million for reimbursement of some cost associated with a build out of a sub station .
let me know if you have any other questions .
regards ,
don
