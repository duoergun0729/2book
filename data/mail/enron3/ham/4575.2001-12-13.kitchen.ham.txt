as you work a deal for newco i wanted to make sure that we include the various tools we use in structuring for pricing and evaluating deals ( i . e . , we want to make sure the newco will have the exclusive rights to this information ) . kelli has provided a basic list of this information below . most relates to the exotica functions ( and any associated code ) that research has created for structuring deals . i am forwarding a copy of this to jim meyn to see if he has any additional needs .
thanks .
