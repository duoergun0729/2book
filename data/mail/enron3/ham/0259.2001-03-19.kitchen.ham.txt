on our two quotes , my comment on the first quote is important ; the second might sound a little better but says the same thing .
the pastoria energy center represents the second major power project developed in california by enron since 1999 , . . .
enron remains committed to helping meet the growing need for reliable and affordable electricity in california through the development of other highly efficient projects .
