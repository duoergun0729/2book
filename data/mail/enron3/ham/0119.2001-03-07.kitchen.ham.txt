aep and the hpl transaction
there is a remote possibility that aep may be slow in fitting out their offices in time for the acquisition of hpl to reach closure sooner rather than later ( essentially all of the wiring in between offices ) . if so brian is putting together a back up plan where they could be sited in our building . this would mean that a link has to be made between their office and here - that ' s where you guys come in . brian will give you a ring to discuss using the direct connection eol is putting in place as an intermediate step .
it might work ?
thanks
