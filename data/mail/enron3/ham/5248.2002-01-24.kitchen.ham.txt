louise ,
i have a bit of an issue with this because the power and gas objectives seem to take a backseat to the eol objectives . for example , bradford said he will not get to my request for my top power counterparties for a couple of weeks because he has a top - 50 eol list that he is working on . there are a lot of counterparties that are important that do not necessarily use eol . eol is an amazing platform , but i dont think eol should be driving the power , gas , legal and credit rampup processes .
