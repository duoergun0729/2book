i will follow up with wes to see if it is already in the plan . i also have a call into rob to inquire if he has any needs for the excess cash either in the short or long term . depending on the response , i will get with steve douglas to look at ways of getting the cash back to the us for debt repayment in the most tax efficient manner . thanks for the heads up .
