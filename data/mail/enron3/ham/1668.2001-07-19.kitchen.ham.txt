dear john ,
my colleagues and i are working with australian power and energy limited ( apel ) that is developing a $ 3 billion synfuel and power plant project in the latrobe valley of australia in victoria using brown coal .
the power plant project will be 1 , 000 mw . part of the synfuel production will be clean - burning diesel fuel of about 35 , 000 barrels a day ( worth about $ 400 , 000 , 000 a year at today ' s prices ) .
apel was wondering whether enron could have an interest in marketing the power and / or the diesel fuel . apel also would be open to suggestions should enron wish to be involved in other ways .
the principals apel are in houston this week and could meet with enron this thursday afternoon , 19 july .
john , would or your colleagues like to meet with apel this thursday , and if so , what time and where would be convenient ?
thanks and best regards ,
