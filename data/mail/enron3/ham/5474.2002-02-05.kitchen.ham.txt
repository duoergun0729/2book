louise ,
as you know , we were told during today ' s integration committee call that marketing ' s and legal ' s text changes for the
website would be accepted any time today . following the call , however , i was told that the noon deadline was firm , but
we could make minor text changes on thursday . based on that information , we forwarded partial comments to kal shah by
noon . in a late afternoon email , i found out that we will not be able to complete our changes until perhaps five days
after the site goes live .
we appreciate the pressure and long hours people in houston are putting into getting the site up and running . we applaud
their efforts and do not wish to add to their burden . i tell you this only to make you aware of our situation , should
any problems arise because of the unedited text . hopefully , if anything does arise , problems can be easily and quickly
corrected .
please call me at 212 - 713 - 8508 if you have any questions or if i can help you in any way .
thank you ,
claudia robinson
