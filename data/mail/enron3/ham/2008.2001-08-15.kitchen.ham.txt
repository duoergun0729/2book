i spoke with ledain in calgary . they had a bid for c $ 3 mm w / out the abb turbines . they are not planning to pursue because lavorato commented that it is better to hold onto the site at that price . the site is permitted for the abb ' s . i have asked ledain to send me their original info memo for the sale of the site ( w / turbines ) ; it might be worth trying to market that project again - time has passed , the market there may open soon , ontario just set a new peak and east prices rallied last week .

can you confirm that we are still talking to the guys in canada with regard to selling the abbs with the moore site . i only mention this as the ' hotlist ' shows that they are planning to sell the site which i am not sure is feasible without combining the turbines .
thanks
