louise ,
i spoke with mark . i believe he is getting a little more comfortable . he is now focused appropriately on the likelihood of the bonds getting issued . he is going to call around to some law firms and i will talk to some bankers , just to get some other opinions . i will have a short presentation for the meeting .
cheers ,
