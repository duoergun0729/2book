john / louise :
brian stanley and i discussed his proposal to consolidate the enron america development engineers under eeos . as you know , there is a lot of noise in the system with respect this topic that is detracting from productivity . i suggest that we need to make a definite decision on whether or not the ena tech services group will be consolidated into eeos or will they remain as a separate group under ena . the stakeholders in this decision include the power / gas origination teams ( e . g . duran , jacoby , calger , etc . ) the various technical groups , and rac . these groups should be consulted to ensure that whatever we do meets their requirements .
i have asked brian s . to arrange a meeting when he returns from his trip on or about june 11 th ( with louise on the phone ) to discuss . this will also ensure we get past some key dates in our construction projects .
regards ,
brian
