Subject: ferc ' s press release re : southern rto
attached is ferc ' s press release on southern rto .
the ferc did the right thing in not approving this rto , but clearly they missed a golden opportunity to mandate gridsouth and southern rto joining together . another signal that more pressure is required to get ferc to open up these transmission markets .

the federal energy regulatory commission rejected two key elements of
southern company services , inc . ' s proposed regional transmission organzation ( rto )
and encouraged the company to explore joining neighboring utilities in an rto for the
southeast . the commission did not act on other issues raised by southern .
southern ' s proposal for a for - profit gridco ( grid company ) that would include only
new wholesale transmission services and have the benefits of certain rate incentives
going to others rather than the rto operator are inconsistent with ferc ' s rto policy ,
the commission said . under southern ' s proposal , existing owners ' transmission facilities
related to bundled retail service or native load would not be under the gridco ' s control .
as a result , the vast majority of total transmission load would not be under the rto ' s
tariff , operation or direction .
the rto rule requires all transmission facilities operate under the transco . in
addition , southern could not plan , design and operate a regional grid in a manner that
maximizes efficiency if the transco controlled only a small part of the rto load , the
commission said in rejecting southern ' s proposal .
as an alternative to filing a revised rto proposal , the commission asked that
southern consider joining neighboring utilities in an rto in the southeast . the
commission directed southern to file a report by july 13 , 2001 , on progress in forming a
southeastern rto .
