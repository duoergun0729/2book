guys - rick whitaker and i will probably still tour the plant so please do not put out any word that we may not bid . i will already be up there for the pjm conf . and rick wants to scope out for future expansion so it is worthwhile .

gentlemen ,
based on our phase 2 valuation analysis and detailed discussion with dana davis , we do not feel we can get to the numbers which we are told are being offered by competitors . we are significantly short of the $ 45 to $ 55 mm that the sellers indicated was shown in the first round . thus , it would be imprudent to incur the costs of on - site due diligence required to complete the process .
we still like the plant at the right price and if those other bids do not materialize we may reconsider if contacted by arclight . thank you for your help during this process .
best regards ,
pete
