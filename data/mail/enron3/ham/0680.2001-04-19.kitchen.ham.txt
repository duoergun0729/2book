Subject: fw : tibco / w 2 k migration
louise ,
with regards to the tibco compatability issue . . . . .
if you dont want to wait for the windows 2000 migration in mid may , it appears that migrating to tibco 6 . 5 in nt 4 requires running a migration script that takes about 15 to 20 minutes , but there is a risk that there would be some interruption if the migration doesn ' t go to plan .
we could go for this friday , and the infrastructure team are already working on modifying a version of the migration script to work on windows nt 4 , in anticipation .
another option would be ask the windows 2000 migration team to switch their roll - out schedule around to pick up the single - deal entry users earlier
please let me know if you are prepared to wait for the windows 2000 roll - out .
regards
steve
