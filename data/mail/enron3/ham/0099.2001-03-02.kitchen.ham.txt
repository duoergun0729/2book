Subject: the list
hey louise , following are a few folks i would suggest making an extra effort to talk to in the very near future , although with the announcement of duran i think he has already begun meeting with these guys .
ozzie pagan - ozzie pagan - ozzie pagan
bernie aucoin - head of power structuring
janelle scheur - ne mid - market
michael brown - ne orig .
heather kroll - se orig .
bruce sukaly - tx orig .
charlie vetters / mike miller - principal investing
these gas guys could use a little attention :
ed mcmichael - head of gas structuring
frank vickers - east gas orig .
laura luce - chicago / midwest gas
i talked with delainey last night and asked him to talk with duran which he did . delainey also talked with michael brown and janelle scheur ( i wasn ' t here ) . i talked with ozzie this morning and delainey is talking with him now . we ' ve asked every one of these guys to stay calm and give this a chance to work . i do think they all have confidence in duran so that ' s good .
personally , i think the baughman announcement was a mistake . baughman is a superb mid - market leader , but the ne isn ' t in need of that . janelle can handle that role with no issues whatsoever . the ne needs a high - powered structured originator that will continue to build and really lead that business . the signal that was just sent with the baughman announcement is that the ne will be a mid - market shop only ( confirming the concerns already up there ) , with no realistic capability of executing on the current business plan .
please let me know if there ' s anything more i can do . it really took a lot of work to get east power finally set up like it needs to be , and i really hate to see it falling apart like this . and remember , we have put out no " bids " for any individual within ena or wholesale .
call if you need anything . . .
