Subject: fw : transferring into the program
my one year anniversary at enron is june lst . at this time , i will be able to apply for transfer into the analyst program . i hope to go back to school in the near future and feel that the analyst program along with my enron experience is the best road to take . it would be very much appreciated if you would help me in this process by writing a letter of recommendation . each of you has been influential to both enron as a whole and myself . i could not think of anyone better to represent me in this way . if you could have this to me by the first week of may , that would be great .
if you need anything from me in this regard , please let me know .
thank you ,
adriane

thank you for your interest in transferring into the program . in order to transfer you must have at least one year of enron experience . along with your resume we would need three recommendation letters ( one from a vp level or higher , one from a current or previous supervisor and the other is your discretion ) and a copy of your recent prc . you must have a rating of strong or higher on your prc to be eligible .
the best course of action at this point is to start collecting all this information for your transfer application packet prior to your one year anniversary . you can submit this information to me about a month from your anniversary date , by having it delivered to eb 1165 c .
if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me .
thanks a bunch !
