Subject: ecc / ena & content
1 ) do you know if netco is going to have similar arrangements in canada to what we had before bankruptcy ? ( e . g . trader in houston trades eastern canada on behalf of ena , but trader in calgary trades western canada on behalf of ecc )
2 ) looks like we might have to prepay 1 month to preserve reuters content . i ' m assuming this is no big deal , as we will still be month - to - month and can cancel .
