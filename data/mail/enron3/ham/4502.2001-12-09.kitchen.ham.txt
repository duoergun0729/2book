Subject: west power lists
this spreadsheet should have everything for west power ( portland and san fran ) and for all people in portland . i have prepared it in a way so that it can be easily sorted . chris and i have reviewed and think that it is complete .
jeanie , could you please ensure that the following people are on a netco list somewhere :
dan dietrich
steve walton
murray o ' neil
terry donovan
dale furrow
also , i think that jeff dasovich is slated to stay in san fran to support the west gas desk . i don ' t know if anyone has considered retention for him .
finally , i put numbers down for the it development people in portland . i have no idea if those numbers are good or not . please run them by steve nat or compare them to someone in a similar role to see if they make sense .
ps - the outside e - mail address is my home e - mail so that i can review if you need me to discuss later .
