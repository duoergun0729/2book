Subject: ees utility contacts
louise , my marketer out of the portland office had word that a ees marketer ( george dickinson ) was looking to contact a utility in the northwest . . . . the reason that ees was looking to do this was to work with the utility on gas structures that perhaps the utility could market to some of their customers and ees would help them create or structure . .
this marketing effort is at the core of what ena - wholesale gas is trying to promote and any third part mix into this effort does not help .
regardless as to where we are at in our marketing efforts and success to date in these efforts . . . . utility business is a ena customer and i consider them a primary wholesale customer .
i have not discussed this is anyone at ees but in my discussions with my peers was led to believe that this issues was tabled with you already and my comments would support your conversations with ees on our behalf .
pls advise if you need to discuss or require anything from me .
regards ,
