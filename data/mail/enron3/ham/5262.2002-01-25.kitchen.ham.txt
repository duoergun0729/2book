Subject: mike bridges
louise ,
in the governance email which you sent , mike bridges was identified as a member of the operational restart sub - committee . i assume you meant mark bridges .
i suspect this might have lead to mike receiving a phonecall today from ubs asking him for information .
an excited mike called me to ask if he is invited to join ubs . i told him that i thought it was a mistake , but that i would confirm it with you .
