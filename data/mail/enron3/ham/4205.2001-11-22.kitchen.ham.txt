Subject: vitro project
brian ,
it occurred to me that we haven ' t spoken about the ongoing management / oversite of the construction of the vitro project in light of next week ' s expected events . while we have discussed eeos ' s role with tractebel , we need to keep in mind that we need a technical person to monitor the construction process to protect enron ' s remaining 20 % interest . i believe steve irvin had planned on using robert rimbau . unsure if robert works for you or virgo , but regardless , enron needs someone to monitor the construction process .
secondly , also keep in mind that we are technically still on the hook to be the operator of the project . while we are working with tractebel to transition out of the operating role , we haven ' t yet completed the transition . we want to make sure that we don ' t breach any agreement with the idb .
let ' s talk as soon as possible to make sure that we have these issues adequately covered . we probably need to engage steve irvin as well . i am unsure of his status , but i will check with louise .
thanks ,
don
