Subject: organizational statistics
attached is an organizational statistics summary for the first half of 2001 . the hr organization has been working to develop meaningful reporting of trends in our employee population . a few highlights from this report :
the employee base continues to grow ( though on a significantly slower pace than 2000 ) .
terminations ( voluntary and involuntary ) are up dramatically this year .
our " contribution loss " ( a statistic which uses terminations weighted by the performance ratings of those leaving ) has gone up , indicating that we are losing more high performers than in previous periods . however , those departures of high performers are concentrated in areas of substantial reorganizations ( ebs , the former ee & cc and hpl ) .
let us know if you would like to see additional items on the report or if you have questions about the data .
