Subject: re : document on it solution
attached hereto is the current draft of transition services agreement pursuant to which enron will provide certain services to netco and netco will rpovide certain services to enron . i hope that this is what you are looking for .
if you are looking for the division of assets between enton and netco , that will be detailed in the schedules to the agreement whereby the vaious assets are transferred to from enron to netco . these schedules list the software and hardware and other assets that will be transferred to netco and the software . hardware and other assets are remaining with enron , as well as those assets ( primarily third party software ) that netco will need to obtain on its own . the transition services agreement is intended in large part to bridge the gap between ( i ) the time of the sale and transfer of assets to netco and ( ii ) time when netco acquires these software programs and other assets .
if you have any questions , please give me a call .
thanks , anne
