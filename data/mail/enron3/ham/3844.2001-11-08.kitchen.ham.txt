john and louise ,
i hope that the sample agreements sent to john earlier were what you had in mind .
i have completed all of the amendment and assignment agreements for those persons with the guaranteed bonus . i will hold on to them until you are ready to fill in the blanks . a few of those employees work for enron canada corp . i am not sure if i can transfer them to the other company in light of tax issues . nonetheless , those are ready , and we can change the new company name if we set up a canadian entity in the next few days .
let me know if you would like any more information . you can reach me at 3 - 6401 or on my cell at 713 - 302 - 5522 .
