Subject: pa and eta approval
fyi : the pa and eta have been with jim petrie of ubs legal for several days , but we still do not have ubs legal approval . i have been hassling mark taylor , who has in turn been hassling jim .
as a result , i am anticipating we cannot begin marketing to our top 50 customers on monday . the splash page will be ready with full functionality monday night , so i am hoping we get approval on monday for a tuesday top 50 marketing launch .
