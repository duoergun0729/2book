Subject: tbg & vng
louise , i know that you are dealing with more important things now but i wanted to keep you up to speed on tbg and vng as i continue to move them forward .
have completed negotiations on tbg . plan to forward execution documents on monday . upon tbg ' s execution i will determine if we want to move forward , delay or terminate the opportunity . i will get with you on this .
i have negotiated a $ 2 million payment from sequent to terminate the asset transaction 1 year early . traders believe this is strong value and are willing to transact at that value . waiting on formal / written offer from sequent to complete evaluation .
will keep you posted on these opportunities .
i hope that you are doing alright given the circumstances
