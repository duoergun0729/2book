good evening ,
> attached , please find an abridged version of our 76 - page report in which
> we provide our supply and demand outlook for 12 regions across the us .
>
> summary :
> 1 . the power markets are regional in nature the fragmented us
> transmission system results in significant regional power pricing and
> economic disparities . in order to fully understand this industry , macro
> analyses of the us market must be supplemented with an in - depth assessment
> of its individual regions .
> 2 . announced projects cannot be taken at face value out of the 285 , 487
> mw of project announcements we have identified , only 26 % are actually
> under construction . our base case analysis suggests that only 53 %
> ( 149 , 944 mw ) of the announced projects will be completed .
> 3 . shortages will persist in several key markets owing to a combination
> of current supply shortages , capacity retirements and demand growth , we
> estimate that the entire us will need 207 , 689 new mws by 2006 in order to
> achieve an equilibrium 18 % capacity margin . this requirement is 39 % above
> our base case buildout forecast . consequently , we project a 2006 capacity
> shortfall of 57 , 745 mw . our analysis indicates that supply shortages will
> be most pronounced in the mid - atlantic , new york , parts of the midwest ,
> and the southeast .
> 4 . positive implications for generators our findings have positive
> implications for selected generators . we believe that calpine ( cpn ,
> strong buy ) , entergy ( etr , buy ) , mirant ( mir , buy ) , nrg energy ( nrg , buy ) ,
> ppl corp . ( ppl , buy ) , and reliant resources ( rri , buy ) are best positioned
> within this market .
