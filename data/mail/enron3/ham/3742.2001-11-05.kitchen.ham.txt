new york , nov 5 ( reuters ) - fitch on monday cut its ratings on the debt of embattled energy trader enron corp . and warned that it may cut the ratings again if the company does not reduce its debts , if its trading business deteriorates or if charges exceed present estimates .
" today ' s rating action reflects the difficulties enron faces in managing its liquidity position in the face of an erosion in investor confidence , " fitch said .
fitch cut houston - based enron ' s senior unsecured debt to " bbb - minus , " one notch above junk , from " bbb - plus , " its subordinated debt to " bb " from " bbb , " and its commercial paper to " f 3 " from " f 2 . " the rating agency also downgraded enron ' s preferred stock to " b - plus " from " bbb - minus . "
fitch said reducing debt and exiting problem businesses are a management priority , and if enron is successful , the company ' s credit profile will improve . " however , the targeted transactions have varying degrees of execution risk , particularly the divestiture of assets in emerging - market countries , " fitch said .
fitch ' s cut follows downgrades last week by moody ' s investors service and standard & poor ' s . enron ' s shares have lost more than 65 percent in less than a month amid concerns about financial practices that triggered an investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission .
s & p last thursday cut enron ' s corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to " bbb , " two notches above junk status , from " bbb - plus . " moody ' s investors service last monday cut enron ' s senior unsecured debt to " baa 2 , " two notches above junk , from " baal . "
downgrades could make it tougher for enron to issue debt and run its day - to - day business if fellow marketers and traders demand more collateral .
enron lined up $ 1 billion of new credit last week but may still have to sell assets to head off a credit squeeze and restore investor confidence , according to investment bankers .
in its third - quarter results report last month , enron said it expected over a billion dollars of write - offs related to soured investments . it also announced an extra $ 1 . 2 billion write - down of shareholder equity related to investments that were not recorded on its balance sheet .
enron ' s 6 . 4 percent notes due in 2006 , bid at about 80 cents on the dollar a week ago , were bid at 73 cents on the dollar on monday , a strategist said .
enron shares were up 40 cents , or 3 . 55 percent , at $ 11 . 67 in midday trade on the new york stock exchange . the shares have been in free - fall for two weeks .

new york - - ( business wire ) - - nov . 5 , 2001 - - fitch downgrades enron ' s outstanding securities as follows : senior unsecured debt to ` bbb - ' from ` bbb + ' ; subordinated debt to ` bb ` from ` bbb ' ; and preferred stock to ` b + ' from ` bbb - ` . enron ' s commercial paper has been downgraded to ` f 3 ' from ` f 2 ' . the senior unsecured debt ratings of its pipeline subsidiaries , northern natural gas co . and transwestern pipeline co . , are lowered to ` bbb - ' from ` a - ` . all the above securities remain on rating watch negative status . fitch would consider further downgrades if enron were unable to make progress in reducing debt , if its wholesale marketing and trading business were to show signs of material deterioration , or if expenses and charges related to the disposition of non - core businesses and investments exceed present estimations .
today ' s rating action reflects the difficulties enron faces in managing its liquidity position in the face of an erosion in investor confidence . this follows the recognition of a substantial diminution in value of its global merchant investments , which were partly financed with an aggressive use of off - balance sheet vehicles . enron should be able to manage through this challenging environment , ultimately recognizing the values of the company ' s core businesses .
in october , enron fully drew down the bulk of its committed bank facilities and paid down outstanding commercial paper , leaving it approximately $ 1 billion of cash on hand to support normal business activities . in addition , the company is in the process of executing a new $ 1 billion secured bank facility that pledges the assets of northern natural and transwestern . unsecured creditors are structurally subordinated to the secured lenders reducing asset coverage . while its current cash position appears adequate , securing additional capital sources through asset sales or raising additional capital would be a favorable development .
a management priority is debt reduction and the exiting of problem businesses . clearly , these actions , if completed as envisioned will reduce risk and improve the company ' s credit profile . however , the targeted transactions have varying degrees of execution risk , particularly the divestiture of assets in emerging market countries . an additional uncertainty is the securities and exchange commission ' s ( sec ) investigation of certain enron sponsored partnerships . the outcome and potential impact of the sec activity is difficult to predict .
the largest announced transaction is the sale of portland general electric co . ( pge ) to northwest natural gas co . the sale appears to be moving ahead as planned and has the favorable support of key local interests . however , the transaction is not expected to close for another year .
enron ' s core businesses have continued to generate strong , predictable performance and have significant value . prospectively , operations at enron ' s domestic regulated pipelines would be less affected by any lingering uncertainty at enron . also , pge is expected to generate positive and predictable earnings and cash flow over the next year . combined , the pipelines and pge generate nearly 25 % of ebitda . wholesale and retail energy services segments have also consistently reported predictable and growing returns . specifically , commodity marketing and trading activities , which comprise the most profitable and largest part of wholesale operations , have generated steady volume growth and stable unit margins . however , if enron were unable to maintain the support of its counterparties or exhibited diminished financial flexibility , these businesses would be harmed .
