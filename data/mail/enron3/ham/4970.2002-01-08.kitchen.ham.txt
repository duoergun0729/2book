it is currently owned by the estate , but i assume ( anne , mark or mark ? ) that it would be assigned to netco as part of that transaction . i should add that we will incur some legal expenses in filing applications in foreign jurisdictions ( although probably not substantial ) . also , an additional benefit of delaying the filing for ten months is that the us patent and trademark office will make an initial determination as to some elements of patentability ( which they do not otherwise do ) - - this would give us some indication of whether it is worthwhile pursuing the patent process .

with respect to prosecuting our business method patent application outside the u . s . , we may now designate those non - u . s . countries in which we are seeking patent protection , or elect to postpone that process for an additional ten months .
if we wish to designate the appropriate countries now , we must file an application in each country in which we want patent protection on or before february 28 , 2002 . if we elect to postpone the process , we must file an notice to that effect on or before january 30 , 2002 . one benefit of taking the ten - month extension of the process is that the u . s . patent and trademark office will review our patent application and issue a non - binding written opinion on whether our invention meets certain conditions ( novelty , inventiveness , industrial applicability ) that are required in order to be patentable .
please let me know whether we should designate countries now , or file for the extension . it may be that we want to let the dust settle on the netco transaction before making this decision .
