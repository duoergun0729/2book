Subject: re : agenda for friday
thanks .
we had reasonably good meetings with ford and gm yesterday ( mike curry on point for this ) . gm may be able to bring delphi and celanese to the table . both companies are interested in further discussions . i am meeting with enron engineers today to have a look at the practical geographic limits for power delivered across the proposed tie ( displacement obviously increases the physical limit ) to help identify additional target customers .
