Subject: broker client
once we have a buyer , subject to their approval , i would like to offer broker client contracts to the existing brokers , with the first x months free with no obligation to continue ( but hopefully they will , and will pay us ) . i think this will help us to rebuild volumes .
please let me know if you disagree .
