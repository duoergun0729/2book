greg / dave :
if the opportunity presents itself at the energy forum , i would appreciate any discussion of the intrastate pipeline market . specifically , the benefits of price transparency and liquidity on the intrastate pipelines to ensure efficient movement of gas to end users . this will become more of a factor with greater instantaneous gas demand due to the dispatch of gas - fired generation .
thanks ,
brian
