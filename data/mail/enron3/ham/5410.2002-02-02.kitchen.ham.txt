Subject: re : contracts listing
dave ,
the download from eol contract database is not the day 1 contract list we will be using . disregard the contract / name type column in your attachment . there are only six initial contract types . master gas , master power , isda and corresponding gtcs . also , we will adjust the initial contract requests by credit approvals . we need to be consistent in what we are communicating to ubs and internally .
thanks ,
bill

subject : contracts listing
attached is a list of company legal names , with enron contract types identified , which some of the recipients of this email have requested .
the groups represented on this list roughly correspond to the groups on the various lists in circulation and should be relevant for relaunch .
the list i sent out earlier today contained some company names which had been identified by commercial groups as top 50 , but in fact will not be trading on day 1 as they do not trade the products which we are planning to launch on day 1 .
accordingly , we will send out a new list tomorrow morning , which will contain :
- names of pipelines or transmission companies needed for day 1
- names of canadian companies needed for day 1
the revised list will show only those names incremental to the " louise approved " list currently being used by credit and will contain the full legal name of the relevant entities .
to avoid any confusion , i suggest you delete the last list i sent you and use the " louise approved " list along with tomorrow ' s list .
if anyone has any questions , please contact me on :

thanks ,
dave
