brad ,
i had a conversation with wally turbeville from vmac at around 11 am . from his conversations with the main players in the industry he got feedback that " they are very enthousiastic about negotiating a deal that would free cash for enron " ( his words ) . he offered his support to negotiate with the industry players and wants to set up a meeting sometimes this week .
