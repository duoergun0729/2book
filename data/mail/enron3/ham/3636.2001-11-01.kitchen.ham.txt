Subject: marathon follow - up
louise ,
yesterday afternoon i spoke with walt madro , sr . vice president of global gas and lng , regarding marathon ' s decision not to pursue a marketing / trading relationship with enron . walt further clarified marathon ' s poisition :
marathon is in final negotiations to acquire a firm with both upstream assets and a small , niche marketing arm .
steve lowden told walt to hold off on the negotiations with enron because of the acquisition of this firm and the potential duplication of marketing compentencies . ( ? ? )
i asserted that this firm , even if acquired , does not have the premier gas and power franchise like enron and walt agreed .
as such , walt will contact me when the deal is completed - expected date is before the end of the year .
i will stay in contact with walt and try to identify the firm being acquired .
ultimately , i do not like how this " smells . " i would like to have a conversation with lowden because the opportunity cost of not having a marketing / trading relationship with enron versus acquiring this small firm ( albeit receiving strategic upstream assets ) , i can not compute intellectually . do you agree ?
