with luce - not shively ( he ' d gone ) . they are all upset by jean ' s approach , nothing to do with john grass at all . i think we move on nug and worry about the way forward for jean when we have our gas meeting - the origination heads plus hunter and arnold .
i think both her and hunter feel that jean is saying they do not know how to do their own jobs - eg managing peoples . apparently there have been a few conversations between jean and origination / trading group heads but not laura .
she fully agreed we want to keep grass .
