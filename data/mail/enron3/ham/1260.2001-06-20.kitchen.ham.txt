attached is a summary of origination income ytd . it does not include the value of the alamac put ( $ 1 . 9 mm ) which will be realized in the third qtr . or the $ 5 . 5 mm for the ecp sale which was booked in ql . as i mentioned this am , i believe a conservative analysis of our current pipeline puts us at about $ 145 mm for the year .
