Subject: re : drift
louise - current status on drift expense allocations . . . . we have reviewed the $ 11 . 8 million in question and that amount is correct given the methodology being used by gary to allocate costs . when gary is back in the office on thursday , i will go through his allocations with him to determine if we need to change that methodology and thus change the allocation percentages . i will let you know the outcome of that meeting .
also , keep in mind that the $ 11 . 8 million represents a plan amount . actuals should be much less since we are currently well under plan headcount amounts and not all plan expenses have been made . let me know if you have any questions - i will keep you updated .
regards ,
brent
