Subject: wellhead support structure
louise ,
i spoke with john and at most , he believes that 6 . 5 employees should be currently staffed under logistics , scheduling and risk management . in addition , overall , the wellhead desk should create a net cost savings across the scheduling and logistics natural gas organization for the following reasons :
1 . the number of schedulers needed on the regional firm desks should be less -
a . scheduling between pooling points is relatively easy
b . the wellhead support is responsible for all the scheduling and logistics duties between wellhead and pooling point - which comprise most of the deliverability risk
2 . the wellhead desk has currently , at most , four schedulers for the whole country -
a . how many schedulers are associated with the firm desks ?
in addition , if the wellhead desk is being straddled with these fixed costs , then all outsourcing deals brought in should be pure margin , no ?
i am having judy thorne and kevin miller dig into the details to verify these points .
