Subject: cinergy til issue
dave ,
just wanted to give you the a quick update on til . ge is coming out to install rev 4 on monday ( see details below ) .
as we discussed earlier today , rev 2 was installed at caledonia in december , soon after signing psa with cinergy . rev 4 is now out and available . if we decide to run , we need rev 4 . ge called today to say that the tech is coming to caledonia on monday to install rev 4 ( or if we delay , it will be two weeks ) . obviously we can ' t wait two weeks . as required in the psa , i called cinergy ( david tang ) to tell him that we are installing rev 4 on monday and tuesday and if they want to send someone to the plant to witness the control curve changes , to send someone out on tuesday ( ge ' s recommendation ) . we will also have ross newlin from oec at the plant .
in addition , we confirmed with michelle april ( ge rep ) today that we are still operating under the original til issued back in december ( which you have a copy of ) .
let me know if you need anything else .
