Subject: dale furrow interview
many of you know dale furrow already . for those who don ' t , he ran our structuring group in portland from late 1997 until the middle of 1999 . he ' s an army grad , wharton grad , went through the associate program and left enron as a director to join entergy ' s asset development group working for jeff roberts . he recently tendered his resignation at entergy and is on the job market . he is leaving entergy on good terms - - he simply decided that he doesn ' t like working there for a variety of reasons .
dale has a great background for many of the ees / ews work that we are trying to do now . he was an awesome structurer . he " gets " trading . he was responsible for the development and implementation of entergy power marketing ' s risk systems . in short , he would be a great catch for us .
i will be in houston monday and tuesday of next week . i will interview dale on tuesday . i know that louise and john are in prc on tuesday , so they would have to do it later . perhaps the rest of us could meet him on tuesday .
i don ' t yet have a specific job nailed down for him . i think that he could run a urm desk ( east or west ) . he could run the site profile , asset profile , dsm group . i would expect that he would expect to come in at a vp level . i know that ' s a high bar and hard to do here , which is why i would want this group of people to meet with him . i have asked debra davidson to contact each of you to coordinate these interviews .
thanks ,
