julie ,
we didn ' t get to finish our conversation in the elevator re : ngpl .
do we expect them to repsond to us . if they think the price is too high then we can start negotiating . if they think any price is too high then we have a problem . given that you have a relationship with the person in charge there , getting a response from them will really help us figure out whether this is going to fly or not .
thanks ,
az
