absolutely , , , , i have talked to steve and david about it , and we will definitely talk about origination . . . what i ' ll do is include it generically in the agenda , because steve might have a complicated week , so if something comes up in his agenda , i ' ll do the talking . we are already working with carlos alatorre and david forster in the material .
best regards .

subject : conference - mexico
louise , about the conference for this month in mexico . the agenda is set for the 19 th in monterrey and the 20 th in mexico city .
we are ready to send out invitations , to around 550 customers via email . i believe the response rate to it , could be from 140 to 250 people .
the variable budget then , would be anywhere between $ 14 , 000 to $ 20 , 000 , depending in the amount of material we will need to print , but we ' ll play it by ear and react as confirmations arrive . costs include room reservation , printed material , translation , and 1 hour of cocktails for our customers after each conference .
conferences will be held in the two " industrial ' s club " , which are some of the best places in such cities .
this is already included in this year ' s budget , but i wanted to let you know .
attached you will find the invitation , and i included you in the agenda to give the welcoming remarks to our customers . let me know if it is ok with you , before sending it out .
>
best regards .
