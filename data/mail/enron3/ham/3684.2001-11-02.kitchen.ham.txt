attached is the final spreadsheet outlining hires / no hires . currently we have 15 selected for hire . however the two with questions were discussed as good hires and perhaps should be looked at again ( both external candidates - tom martin ' s group ) .
i will circle around with you today to discuss further - so we can proceed with offers with your approval .
thanks , karen .
ps - our external candidates did very well .
