mike shanker called today and wants to spend tuesday through thursday next week in our office reviewing at a more detailed level the functional responsibilities within operations and accounting . his goal , on behalf of frank bisignano ( which i am sure that i have misspelled ) , is to map the job functions that we have into the job functions as they are organized within solomon smith barney .
i told him that we would be glad to work with him . we will involve bob hall , jeff gossett , stacey white , leslie reeves and others as needed in these more detailed discussions .
mike says that wes is sending him a functional org chart for his team today . i will touch base with wes to make sure we are coordinated on our efforts .
is this the entity that had requested org charts that you asked for ? - - sally
