Subject: information for desc ' s proposal
i just received the information to prepare desc ' s proposal . i am sending a copy to steve to houston ,
and the original to marc to monterrey , first thing tomorrow morning .
as you will see , the information is very detailed , and was prepared by protego ( aspe & souza ) for
desc ( they paid for the study ) , and luis tellez has asked us to keep it confidential .
dr . tellez main concerns , which should be reflected in our proposal , are :
1 ) 10 & 15 years schemes .
2 ) he wants to enjoy the benefits of price changes in the texas market .
3 ) he does not want to be attached to a single technology ( i . e . inside the fence power plant )
but rather enjoy the benefits ( and risks ) of being part of a market .
