louise , that is fine and at the end of the day a decision to be made by gil and the weather group . just for the record , i want you to understand that i was very candid with my conversation with mike and did not sugar coat any of our issues . i was not trying to lay off a problem into another group . that being said , i was told that they felt that gil may have some skills that would be beneficial in their group .

louise , egm may be interested in extending a job offer to gil to work in the weather group . i had a discussion with mike mcconnell and gave him my general opinion . i may have oversold . i will keep you posted .
in addition , jared kaiser is returning from egm and will take over the lead origination role in the southeast as we have discussed .
