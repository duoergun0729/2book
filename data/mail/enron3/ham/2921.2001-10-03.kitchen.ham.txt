Subject: delegations of authority
louise ,
attached is a new table derived from the list we reviewed on thursday .
this table , combined with the bod approved transaction approval process ( tap ) on the rac website ( rac . corp . enron . com ) , should provide originators in the americas with a roadmap for seeking spending approval and indicate where authority and responsibility lies for such approval . ( fyi , the tap is likely to change at the next board meeting - - i ' ll send you a revised version next week . )
the next step is an initiative to improve spending controls by linking dash approved levels to the accounting and treasury systems . rick carson will be heading up this project and coordinating with accounting and treasury for support .
please distribute this as you see fit within your team . let me know if any changes are required .
regards ,
chip schneider
