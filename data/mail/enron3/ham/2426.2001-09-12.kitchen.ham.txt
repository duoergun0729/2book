Subject: re : end of quarter funds flow targets
louise , i can certainly put this together for you but i ' m not sure it will be of much use - canada has always been considered as " restricted cash " since the ena cannot sweep without cross - border tax implications . as a result , houston in the past has not required any cash flow numbers . please advise , thanks , rob .

subject : end of quarter funds flow targets
as we approach the end of the quarter we are closely monitoring our funds flow targets for enron americas . we would like you to let us know if you are planning to enter into any transactions within your groups which will impact those targets , either positively or negatively . we would like information on all deals which impact significantly our funds flow targets prior to you entering into them . please note that this is not just structured transactions but even a storage transaction where we would be injecting would involve cash going out of enron .
enron ' s cash liquidity position is very strong and there is not an issue of whether or not we enter into a transaction but we must ensure we correctly price any transactions and indeed send clear signals to the orginators and traders with regards to our funds flow targets .
please let john or louise know if you have any transactions which may occur with funds flow implications . should you need any indications of pricing , please contact joe deffner .
