janelle and i met this morning regarding the churn for ecso 5 / 06 et al .
in order to be able to meet the deadline of next weekend , we will have to have all churns submitted no later than monday , january 28 @ 2 : 00 pm . we will not be able to allow any adds / changes past that point .
should we be unable to meet the deadline at 2 : 00 on monday we will need to look at pushing back a week . one option might be ( if all churns aren ' t submitted on time ) to move all non ubs people off of ecs 05 & 06 on the 2 / 1 weekend , and then " shuffle " every eon else the following
thanks , call me if you have any questions
