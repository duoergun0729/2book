on our two quotes , my comment on the first quote is important ; the second might sound a little better but says the same thing .
the pastoria energy center represents the second major power project developed in california by enron since 1999 , . . .
enron remains committed to helping meet the growing need for reliable and affordable electricity in california through the development of other highly efficient projects .

my only comment is that the project is referred to pastoria energy facility and pastoria energy center . the name of the llc is pastoria energy facility llc . calpine ' s wholly - owned sub , pasotia energy center llc , will be purchasing 100 % of ena ' s membership interest in pastoria energy facility .
