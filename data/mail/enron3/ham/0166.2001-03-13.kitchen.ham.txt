Subject: cinergy 203 update
just received a call from sam behrends at leboeuf . he just spoke to the ferc about cinergy 203 . they are working on 203 as we speak . appear to have everything that they need . he reminded them that we want to close this quarter . sam ' s best guess is early next week for order to be issued . he said , once they finish writing order , it goes upstairs for a couple of days and then usually takes two days to get published . still leaves plenty of room for lq close ( on or around the 27 th ) .
i will let you know if i hear anything else .
thanks ,
don
