louise ,
although our actual content contracts are under conrol , it looks like we may need to spend $ 250 , 000 for infrastructure ( portalbuilder license ) .
i will investigate further this afternoon to see if there are any alternatives .
do you want us to spend the money if the alternative is no content ?
