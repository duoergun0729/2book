Subject: swerzbin doc
mike and i both negotiated contracts with jim fallon that originally started in september of 1999 that were to end in september of 2001 . these original contracts were signed , i believe , in october or november of 1999 . they were both done under enron corp . then , in the beginning of 2000 , the contracts were redrafted and done under ena and extended through the end of 2001 . i think that you are missing the original doc that was done in 1999 that had a signing bonus . if you look at sept 99 to sep of 01 mike was paid 434 in year 1 and 3 ? ? in year 2 . i have asked mike to bring in the original doc from 1999 that had the signing bonus . perhaps hr might have a copy as well .
