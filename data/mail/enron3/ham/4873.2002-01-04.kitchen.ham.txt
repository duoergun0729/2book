Subject: umbrella transaction
just a quick fyi ;
if we end up doing deal with umbrella , our review of their benefits package seems to indicate it will cost many of employees significantly more for the same level of medical and dental coverage , as much as $ 5000 pa .
i plan to raise this with john donnelly and see if we can negotiate a softer landing for people , but i wanted you to know that this will cause quite a stir if we proceed without any pay rises or special subsidy for the rank and file .
