john ,
as promised please find attached the updated capital charge presentation for you to distribute to department heads . i am still working on more examples to present . i am considering the effect of the cost of capital curves in valuing option premia . i will have to discuss with rac . i am setting up meetings with risk management starting monday to see how we are going to implement the charge in teh book . i will be trying to sit with yourself as well and discuss how you see the charge / benefit flowing through the different books .
we have also discussed the cost of capital concept with joe deffner from egf - na ( they are working on a similar concept with louise ) and will be liaising weekly with them from funds flow pricing signals .
