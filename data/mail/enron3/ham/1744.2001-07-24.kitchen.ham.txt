tom :
linda has asked that we put together a paper , similar to the format you used for one of the california orders , for the ferc ' s recent rto orders . this is somewhat difficult because ferc issued 6 rto orders plus two procedural orders establishing this new mediation procedure to produce one northeast rto and one southeast rto . and , unfortunately , i ' m going to be at ferc all day tomorrow .
attached is a compilation of the summaries we prepared on the various rto orders . i worked a little on the opening paragraph , but after that it ' s just a cut and paste from the summaries prepared by several of us .
do you have time to work on another great tom paper ? i tried to include all of the substance , but it really needs revisions and restructuring in order to be helpful to the uninformed reader .
i ' ll call you during a break to see if you ' re available .
thanks tom
