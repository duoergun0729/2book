we have had generally good success working with your traders and credit departments working on mutually beneficial 3 - way offset transactions . much appreciated . even today in the west . but i don ' t think your pjm or ercot traders agree with the worthiness of that type of activity . pjm trader will not participate without a spread and ercot trader won ' t even discuss . we are not panicked here but trying to make credit room for continued trading activity makes sense for us all . i have informed our traders to be o
pen to such opportunities , but not to actively seek them out because of the confidentiality provisions in our contracts . that ' s why the interaction of your traders is vital . there are two pending opportunities in pjm and ercot . hope you can help .
i also just got a writeup of a potential new 4 - year deal in the west our guys are negotiating with your ees supply desk . i am reviewing now . of course it only adds to our mutual credit exposure , so making room in other areas makes so much sense .
