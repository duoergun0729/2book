Subject: loretta pricing
john and louise -
based on your meeting with kevin and dave earlier today , i understand you would like a breakdown of the expenditures expected to develop a texas coal plant to the point that it can be monetized .
the below is my best estimate for developing the brownsville site to get to the monetization point ( permits in hand and epc contract signed ) . i expect to have both an epc contract and permits in hand some time around sep ' 02 if we start with the expenditures in mid july ' 01 . expenditures will be incurred at the rate of approximately $ 350 , 000 per month for the next 12 months . we can back out at any time with only prompt month plus one additional month committed .
costs for a florida site will be similar ; however , expenditures will not start until we achieve site control .
my recommendation is to start fully developing the brownsville , tx site with a plan to flip the site once we have a permit , as market conditions warrant . i recommend holding off on significant expenditures in florida until we get more comfortable with site control .
