louise :
is enron ready for this ? i think it is a good suggestion for the most significant deals . it is really positive in that it would force dealmakers to pay more attention to what the contracts provide . i am not sure it makes sense to follow this procedure for every deal that is dashed . let ' s talk about what are the objectives . great question !

we have spoken about this before , the issue is that enron americas has no approval mechanism for contracts . neither does any other group but that is not my problem . i have spent too much time reading dash forms which really do not provide full authorization .
there are two suggestions that i would like to be implemented :
( i ) dash forms need to include all of the contracts which are to be signed under the deal . so if a dash is signed then this authorizes all of the contracts to be signed in the deal . any contracts which are not included need to go through the process outlined below .
( ii ) all contracts need a contract approval form attached and enron ' s legal team cannot initial any contract until this form has been completed ( ie signed ) by the following enron staff .
trader / originator _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
head of group ( vp or above ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
tech services ( where applicable ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
commercial support ( where applicable ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
a database of all completed contracts on behalf of enron americas needs to be maintained by legal .
thoughts please ?
