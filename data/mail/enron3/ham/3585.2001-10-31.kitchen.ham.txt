Subject: tbg
louise , need to ask a question for clarification . tbg is ready to sign . the settlement is structured to change the transaction beginning nov 1 . if we delay , they may revert in nov to operating and scheduling volumes according to the existing agreement and not the settlement agreement , which is bad for ena . a bit of a balancing act but i think that i have it under control . my question is this . can i move forward with the execution of the settlement if the payment is not required until nov 30 ? i am sorry and i may be splitting hairs , but don ' t want this to slip away . if i need to hold off on everything i will do what is needed .
