hi louise . a few questions / issues when you have a moment :
1 . will netco need a copy of infinity for interest rate / fx trading and risk management ? i pitched the question to jeff golden . he thinks the bank will provide this function and the technology , but he wasn ' t 100 % sure .
2 . we have a potential problem with visas . bob hillier is on an ll visa , and many of the development staff are on hlb ' s . once we get a letter from the new entity stating that these people have employment , the transfer process can begin , but it will take at least a week for ll and 2 - 3 weeks for hlb ( this is what i am told ) . if closing happens very quickly after the actual party is chosen , we are going to be squeezed . one solution may be to let all these people continue to work for enron until the visa transfer is complete . otherwise , we will have to send them home without salary or benefits in the meantime .
3 . when you have a moment , i would like to talk to you about two ees people .
thanks !
