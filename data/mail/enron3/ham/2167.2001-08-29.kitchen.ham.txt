Subject: california power authority
california power authority ( " cpa " ) held its first meeting with developers last week . we attended and presented ourselves as a potential developer and seller of turbines to either the cpa or cpa developers . cpa has issued a form of non - binding loi for interested developers to sign . it needs to be signed in the next 24 hours ( ! ) in order to stay in the cpa program . i would like to do that ( subject to legal edits ) so that we can stay at the table .
i bring this to your attention because it may be press - released that we have reached agreement with cpa and that we are offering to build a project for the cpa .
please let me know if you have any issues with this .
regards ,
chris calger
