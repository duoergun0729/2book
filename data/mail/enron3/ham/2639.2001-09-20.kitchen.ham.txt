Subject: eol organization
can brad richter and savita puthigai attend the next trader meeting you have to let all the traders know that savita and her organization ( call center , product control , business analysis , trader support , etc . ) now report officially to brad richter going forward and not jay webb ?
savita and i discussed this today and we both agree that this is best and that explicit change should occur now . savita is still committed to staying until the end of 2001 , getting in some new talent in her group , training brad , working with webb , taking care of the traders , etc . i will talk with her in december or january about what might be next for her .
jay webb is also supportive of this . when he and i agreed that savita reporting to him was taking him away from a large , complex development job , he said brad should take the role . jay works well with brad and thinks brad , with time , will work well in andy zipper ' s old role . jay also signed a new contract recently and is committed to leading all technical and operational issues for enrononline and will be working closely with brad and savita .
let me know your thoughts .
