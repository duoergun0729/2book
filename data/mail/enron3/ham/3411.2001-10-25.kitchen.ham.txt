Subject: attached is a simple power origination case study that i have developed for use at mba functions as an alternative to a generic one - hour presentation about enron . it will be used for the first time at georgetown tomorrow . i thought this tool , or a derivative thereof , could also be useful in early identification of potential " origination track " associates from the associate pool , as it covers issues related to project development , risk analysis , financial evaluation and debt financing .
i would be happy to think together with you on changes to the case that would enhance its value to the origination track program .
regards ,
