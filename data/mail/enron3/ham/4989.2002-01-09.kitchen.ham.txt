subject : martin lin and power fundamentals
kevin & lloyd ,
as we re - asses the fundamental information needed by the traders , i think that it is important to actively recruit martin lin to the power fundamentals group .
martin lin has developed and continuously improved the current short term and long - term interconnect and ercot models as well as played an important part in bringing fourth advancements with powerworld . he is the only person that has extensive and significant working familiarity with the ercot power system . he is of significant importance if we continue to make any changes or improvements to the current interconnect and ercot models . his knowledge extends beyond the process of the flow of electricity and the transmission of power to include the ability to program in c + + and vba . in regards to powerworld , he has both academic and practical expertise as well as a technical understanding of the functionality of the program . he has been leading the advancements with powerworld in order to tie in powerworld with the interconnect models as well as utilize powerworld to conduct contingencies analysis and automatic atc calculations . another area of expertise is his knowledge of options . he has worked on options models for broadband services .
if you have any questiosns in regards to the impact of his continbutions , please feel free to contact myself or steve benchluch .
thank you
