john , wes and michael ,
the purpose of tomorrow ' s meeting is to discuss a few of the investments that we are planning on transferring to the new investment group . the specific issues are as follows :
? encorp - the value of this investment was written up from $ 3 million to $ 9 . 85 million in q 4 2000 without justification . it should be written back down at the end of this quarter . otherwise , we are going to have a bigger problem later .
? dais analytic - same issue as above . investment was written up from $ 8 million to $ 20 million . it should be written back down this quarter .
? amps - this is a problem . this company is going to continue to need capital ( an additional $ 7 million immediately ) well beyond what enron should be funding . i am not willing to provide this company with ongoing funding without significant further evaluation . if it is that important to the strategic effort of ena , then i recommend that ena continue to manage the company and provide financing .
? bridgeline - after further evaluation , it is clear that this is not a merchant investment and should not be moved to my group . i spoke with jeff donahue , and we both agree that if you want it sold , then his team should be the right one to do it .
? copel - this one is fuzzy , but jeff donahue and i have agreed that one of us should take responsibility for exiting this investment . we still need to figure this one out .
