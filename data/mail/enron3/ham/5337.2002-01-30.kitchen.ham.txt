Subject: hsr and the top 50 customers tomorrow
re : the hsr waiting period issue :
we can proceed with our plans , but all correspondence will be handled through the ubs call center in connecticut .
i plan to start doing this tommorrow morning , assuming we get the connecticut fax and phone numbers tonight .
detailed changes :
- fax number will be in connecticut , and will roll to here .
- connecticut call center person will answer any help desk calls , which will then be transferred here .
- connecticut call center will send pa faxes in accordance with instructions from here .
- cover letter will have ubs letterhead , but will be unsigned and will specify connecticut numbers
- splash page will be modified to show connecticut numbers
- once we reach closing date , the numbers will be permanently forwarded to here .
- all future correspondence ( and the bulk mailings ) will specify the houston number
the concern is that during the waiting period , we need for ubs people to represent ubs interests on all official correspondence with customers .
please call me if you have any concerns . i plan to put out the revised splash page and start the top 50 marketing efforts at about 10 : 00 am tomorrow morning .
