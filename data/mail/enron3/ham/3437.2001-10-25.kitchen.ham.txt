Subject: customer positions
the enclosed spreadsheet shows the net online position by product , by counterparty , for a number of liquid gas products . each column represents the life - to - date position generated on that product , for that customer , through the date in the heading of the column .
i don ' t see an immediate indication of these customer closing out of positions .
if i can put this into a more convenient form , let me know what would help .
thanks !
