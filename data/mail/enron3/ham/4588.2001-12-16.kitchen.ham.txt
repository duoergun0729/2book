Subject: url for eol
there is an open issue with respect to how the url address will be positioned between the estate and netco . it was my understanding that we wanted it retained at the estate with a pointer to netco , and a window box back to eol . please call john casaucoumeq ( with whom i understand you will be speaking tomorrow at some time ) ( 212 723 9661 ) and determine with him how this is to work . citi lawyer said however you and he work it out will be satisfactory as it is a business issue . please let anne and i know . thanks . mary
