Subject: potential partner hr data request
michelle / jeff ,
john donnolly , head of hr this potential partner , asked me this afternoon for the following data . we have this and can send it , but can you confirm that it is ok :
employment agreements for " top 5 "
summary of last 12 months total compensation ( including base , bonus , lti , keysop , retention and contracts payments ) .
i promised to get this to him tonight or tomorrow .
seems to me if they have signed a confidentiality agreement and we are close to a deal with them this maybe appropriate . i ' d volunteer to take the names off and just have our gis numbers as a code , but suspect this will confuse everyone .
