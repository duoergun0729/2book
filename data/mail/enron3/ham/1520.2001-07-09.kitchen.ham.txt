Subject: california update 07 . 09 . 01
the bond legislation
the democrats in the assembly and sentate have agreed to language to create a dedicated rate component to repay the budget and de - link the bonds from the dwr contracts .
but the republicans have still not agreed to go along .
the bill would require a 2 / 3 ' s vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule , so republican votes are necessary .
the republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along .
the conference committee
senator burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the core / noncore proposal .
using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure , but how much longer is uncertain .
no sense yet of when hearings on the core / noncore proposal - - - in conference committee or otherwise - - will take place , though burton continues to say that he wants to " give it a chance . "
the core / noncore legislative language
the negotiating group continues to work on the language .
the language was supposed to be delivered to hertzberg by cob today , but more work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing tomorrow morning .
senator dunn ' s investigative committee hearing
the hearing ' s been moved from tomorrow to wednesday .
best ,
jeff
