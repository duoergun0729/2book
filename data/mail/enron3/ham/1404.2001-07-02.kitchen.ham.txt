i am back in the office this morning after a week ' s vacation . i will get the facts and get back with you . confirmations have been prepared in houston all along for the monterrey office . after the doorstep review , we designated a specific point person here in houston to be the primary liasion with the monterrey office . that individual is bilingual , a key factor in choosing him for the role . i will get back with you later today .
who should be our primary contact in monterrey now that max has joined the puc ? - - sally

can you do me a favour and check into the back office work done in houston for mexico , it appears that there are some delays on execution of agreements which i believe the confirms group is supposed to do . they only have 53 deals this year so its not many . is houston the best place to do this bearing in mind language and cultural issues . i realize it was moved from mexico following a doorstop but the monterrey office is very concerned about the back log .
thanks
