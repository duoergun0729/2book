is the size of the cargo that enron would need to purchase approx 280 , 000 bbls with a value of roughly $ 6 million ?

i have a term sale to colonial oil for 1 cargo per month into jacksonville florida . i did not deliver the november cargo and they agreed to wait until dec 10 th . i can ' t perform on this commitment unless we can open an lc or pre pay in order to buy a cargo . money would not be tied up more than a few days . would like to perform and avoid any potential additional costs and / or damage to our credibility due to non - performance . please advise .
