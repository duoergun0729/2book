the new york 780 3 rd ave office is closed and has been inventoried . i am now working on the removal of the it equipment . the 520 madison office is leased under mg metals and only a few ena employees remain at that location . chicago , montreal and toronto include some mg people and i am hoping to have some clarity on these locations early in the new year .
i appreciate your assistance

ok
please check with don miller too . netco does not want san francisco going forward and probably not chicago .

we have asked epsc to pay the following leases for the month of january based on feedback from ena commercial leadership . my understanding is that we may still reject these leases under the bankruptcy if we do so by feb 2 . i will revisit the status of these leases with you before february rents are to be paid .
calgary
portland
san francisco
chicago
denver
i have also been contacted by paula corey , who is working on the enterprise strategy for the retrieval and disposition of remote office contents in the event any of these offices are closed . i will keep you posted on the recommendations .
regards ,
