paul goddard is a manager in the london office looking to come home to canada ( calgary or toronto ) and has spoken to paul in toronto . paul is a strong manager who has been in the organisation for several years . i know that paul has a position offer in dynegy ( from pope obviously ) . i think that it would be good for you to have a chat with him to see if there is a fit as i wouldn ' t want to lose him . at the moment , he seems very keen on toronto and working in power retail - he definitely doesn ' t want to leave enron .
his number is + 44 7748 932298
thanks
louise
