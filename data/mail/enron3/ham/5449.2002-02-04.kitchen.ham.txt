i have had discussions with bryant . he was disappointed as to the reduction in the equity because as he says " he is in this for the long run " . however , i can get him done at current structure if move 50 / 50 to 55 / 55 . is that possible ? that adds a total of $ 10 k over a 2 year period with 50 % cash ( $ 5000 ) in the first year and 50 % equity ( $ 5000 ) in the back . seems like it should not be a deal breaker .
