hello andy .
it ' s been a long time since we talked , but i trust that things are well with
you and lea .
the reason for my email is that my business partners sunil hirani and dik
blewitt are going to be in houston visiting with ken lay at 10 : 30 a . m . on
wednesday . i think that you would find their business ( trading credit risk )
to be of interest , and i know they would like to meet you .
would you have any time on your calendar for lunch or for an introduction
during the afternoon ?
briefly , sunil is the co - founder of creditex , a the credit derivatives
trading platform that the market has adopted as the e - market for credit
derivatives . dik is chief strategic officer of creditex .
my relationship with dik and sunil comes from our shared interest in trading
syndicated loans . creditex and i have co - founded loanx , inc . , to do for the
loan market what creditex has done for the credit derivatives market .
sorry for the out - of - the blue email , but i look forward to catching up with
you in the future .
i ' ve copied sunil and dik to facilitate any schedule coordination that might
be possible .
my best to lea .
