we have offered re - employment to dierdre mccaffrey and she has accepted effective today . we need to reinstate her back to december 5 , 2001 . robert jones is handling all needed paperwork , etc . dierdre was in egm - freights markets prior to being terminated on 12 / 03 / 01 . prior to egm , she spent numerous years in various positions in wholesale gas structuring , trading , and origination . she was instrumental in identifying , evaluating , and negotiating most of our gas asset management transactions . she worked with laura luce and team on the peoples ' gas transactions , and she will be critical in ensuring we maintain and optimize these contracts and positions going forward . she will be working with laura luce in the enron estate .
thank you .
