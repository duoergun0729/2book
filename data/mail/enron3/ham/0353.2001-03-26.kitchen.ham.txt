michelle ,
see below . lets see how many we can get louise by 12 - 1 pm
presto ' s needs to chnage to 1 / 3 1 / 3 1 / 3 grants rather than all next week , so hold his back .
louise , michelle and i just spoke and she is checking the drafts that were prepared this weekend and making some changes . you will have them in batches during course of the afternoon . obviously these are drafts and will need to be redone before anyone can sign ( and potentially changed to modify strike date language in case they elect that option ) . in addition , i thought we were only focusing on the first 15 names on john ' s spreadsheet at least for this 2 day exercise ? your list below includes a number further down . i thought we agreed we could hold off on them until next week ? i don ' t think we will be able to get all the 46 done over next 2 days and would recommend we focus initially on top 15 or so .
kari / sheila , please be on point to ferry these forms back and forth today and tomorrow . we need someone to focus purely on this for the next 48 hours .
