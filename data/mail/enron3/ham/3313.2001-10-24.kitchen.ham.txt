north american gas prices have increased recently , and power prices have followed . the american gas association released storage numbers recently that appear low to our team . although these developments may create a difficult near - term environment , enron americas does not view the current strength in commodity prices to be sustainable .
? enron americas closed on the sale of an 80 % interest in a 240 mw power plant in monterrey , mexico , to tractabel for approximately $ 40 million in cash and the assumption of all the related forward obligations by the buyer .
