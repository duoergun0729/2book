ferc to examine more price mitigation
it is reported that ferc will be looking at hr 1974 by rep doug ose ( r - ca ) as the basis for expanding their mitigation efforts . basically it expands mitigation efforts to apply around the clock rather than in emergency instances . the letter from rep . tauzin to ferc chairman hebert which prompted hebert to call the meeting on monday is supported by 14 house republicans . at this time , it appears ferc is seriously considering expanding price mitigation to the wscc states . however , the administration still opposes price controls , and in case price controls are applied , secretary abraham yesterday inoculated against taking responsibility by saying " ferc is an independent agency . . " the ferc agenda will apparently examine at least four price mitigation cases california filed with ferc :
? extending ferc ' s current price mitigation efforts to all wscc states and amending the current price limits applicability - - now in effect only during stage three power emergencies in california - - to 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
? requiring power generators in the entire western region to sell available electricity to california or into their local power grids during emergencies , reducing the threat of blackouts .
? establishing a regional framework for large power users to sell electricity back into the grid during peak usage times . some companies that have long - term power contracts at low rates may be able to make money by scaling back their operations and selling electricity .
? expanding an order issued last year that authorized refunds for excessive markups during the most extreme power emergencies . that refund order would now apply to excessive prices during all power emergencies .
attached below is rep . tauzin ' s letter to commissioner hebert and likewise hrl 974 .
