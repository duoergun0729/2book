Subject: abb and texmex
louise ,
it is possible that abb will raise the subject of our option with them for the construction of the hvdc tie while in our meeting tomorrow .
as you know , we paid a considerable sum in the past for this option , which effectively expires at the end of november .
under current market conditions , i think it will be possible to pay a much lower sum - and in fact , i think we can apply this sum against the abb contracted project cost in the event we proceed .
no decisions are needed on this tomorrow , and it might not even come up - but clearly , we ' ve kept these guys hanging on the line for some time now and i expect that realistically we will not be in a position to give them a notice to proceed until middle of next year , given contracting and presidential permit issues .
