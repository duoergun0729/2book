Subject: ena / ees gov ' t . affairs org . and budget
jim steffes forwarded to janet late monday the recommended organization and budget ( $ 6 . 4 million total for both companies ) . jim should be the primary point of contact on both the budget and gov ' t affairs organization for ena / ees ( i ' ll address remainder of issues with whalley , kean , and fallon ) . as an aside , it ' s possible the $ 6 . 4 million could be reduced somewhat as we begin to mitigate legacy real estate issues and also consider locating the houston - based staff in the above - referenced organization in available space with the business unit ( s ) . thanks .
