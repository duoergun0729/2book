the mna covers form commodity and trading agreements entered into between specified dynegy and enron entities . i spoke with sheila tweed ( who did the sithe deal ) about this and we got comfortable that no aspects of the sithe deal were done under the form trading agreements or between the specified entities . in addition , the enron corp . guaranty that will be used in connection with the mna will not supersede the enron corp . guaranty issued in connection with the sithe transaction .
