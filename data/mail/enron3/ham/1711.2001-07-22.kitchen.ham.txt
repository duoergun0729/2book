dear all ,
as referenced in the iep legislative report sent out by us last evening ,
senator joe dunn took up the report by his senate select committee to
investigate market manipulation on the senate floor moments ago today
( 07 / 21 / 2001 ) . his procedural purpose was to have the report referred to the
senate rules committee . his statement was that , " enron continues to remain
out of compliance with the committee " and that this report details the
entire committee ' s procedures in requesting internal documents from enron as
well as its reasoning for sanctions against enron , as listed in the last
paragraph of the report . there was no objection to the report heard on the
floor and the report was referred to the senate rules committee for further
action .
