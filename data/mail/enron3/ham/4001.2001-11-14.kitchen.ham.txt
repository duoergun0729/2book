i would like to move forward with what we are calling phase iii for eol . most of the work is done but in this environment , i don ' t want to prepare to roll it out in january without your views . however , if we are to roll it out in mid - january , we need to agree soon .
richter has sent you the outline / presentation on e - mail and he and savita and jay can describe it all in greater detail if you like .
savita discussed the presentation and the plan with john arnold and he is supportive of the rollout and the new look and functionality .
basically it will include a new home page and a new garden page , but the key parts are the expanded quotes screen and the order manager which are a much better use of real estate than the static reuters content down the side ( which will be put in a mycontent button ) . this isn ' t expensive , most of the work is done anyway , but it is a new look and the quotes screen will now be expanded .
i think it would be positive to do . it looks better , the reuters content can be found in a mycontent button and we can use the entire quotes screen to enhance order flow and improve the counterparty experience . it also shows business as usual with enrononline .
your thoughts ?
