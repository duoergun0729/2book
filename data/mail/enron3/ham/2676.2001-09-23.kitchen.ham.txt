hi louise ,
currently we have 2001 forecast and 2002 plan as the information to be provided to you on the templates . would you like for us to add in 2001 plan , as we did for the back - office presentations ?
also , have you had an opportunity to create the goals & objectives portion of their presentation ?
fyi - each team has completed their expense portion of the plan presentation . i ' ll send up a book monday - the teams are still working on the 2001 margin forecast , so i ' ll send that update as soon as it ' s available .
