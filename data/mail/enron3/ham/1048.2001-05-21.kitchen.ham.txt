john ,
it is not relevant that it is not standard practice within ets to grant origination for closed deals . on ecf ' s behalf , bilberry and hilgert negotiated a storage transaction that brings significant value to your business for which they should be appropriately compensated and rewarded . also , the prc process within business units is often not an appropriate mechanism to validate a person ' s p & l for transactions closed across business subsidiaries of enron .
the value associated with the storage transaction was indeed a significant component of p & l to the overall formosa deal . i do not understand how you could infer that the deal was worth over $ 50 million to enron . at best , the current value of the closed transaction across egm , ecf and ena is under $ 10 million . in addition , egm did compensate bilberry and hilgert for their origination efforts associated with the unwind of the teppco contract and incremental transportation volumes from williams .
i certainly hope we can work out this p hilgert , chris

congratulations on closing the deal with formosa , teppco , et al . it sounds like it was a very complex negotiation with a number of different players .
clean fuels is certainly pleased with the new long term storage arrangement with formosa . we will begin working with them to better define the operating parameters ( timing , pressures , volumes , etc ) so we can develop the specific facility plans and cost estimates as necessary .
you had also mentioned that you might be willing to share the management presentation that was put together for this deal ? that would be very interesting reading and i would appreciate a copy if possible .
thanks again , john goodpasture
