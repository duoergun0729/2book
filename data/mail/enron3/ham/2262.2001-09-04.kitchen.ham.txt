louise :
we will receive the $ 2 million when aes and tva execute an interconnection agreement for aes ' haywood project . while it is possible that this agreement will be executed this month ( 50 % ) , it ' s equally as likely that it will happen q 4 . aes is currently under construction on their haywood project , and as such , they need to get this agreement wrapped up asap . our role in this is to utilize our resources ( primarily our consultant who is a former tva director ) to help aes through the process ( and in doing so , we will receive our upside payment of $ 2 million ) . we are doing everything we can to reach this milestone in q 3 .
we can talk about this before our conference call if you like .
regards ,
ben
