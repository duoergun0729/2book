for what ever reason , in the system , he is coded in the executive committee job group . your reports only include job groups of md down to managers . ranabir is coded wrong because he is not an executive committee member and this is why he is not in any of your reports . i will get with is hr rep and get this corrected . if you would like , in the meantime , i can run the report information on him .
thanks , tarsie broussard
