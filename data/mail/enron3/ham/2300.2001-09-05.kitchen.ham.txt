jim ,
i listened into the call for the puc press conference and they plan to go forward with the vote tomorrow regarding direct access ; however , they will not vote on the rate order until a later time due to the high volume of comments ( they predict it will be voted on before sept . 20 th though . ) let me know if you need more info about the call . thanks , a .
