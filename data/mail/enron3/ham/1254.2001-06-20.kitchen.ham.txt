Subject: analyst & associate summer picnic
attached is an invitation to the summer picnic this saturday , june 23 from 4 : 00 - 9 : 00 pm at the regal ranch . many of you may have already received this , but i wanted to extend my personal invitation to you . this is a really fun activity , and has traditionally been one of the best opportunities to visit with our program participants on an informal basis . this is a family outing with lots of activities for the kids , and you can come and go as you please .
please make an effort to attend on saturday , even if you can only join us for a little while . feel free to pass this invitation on to other executives in your business unit . the analysts and associates tell us that this type of exposure to our business leaders helps drive excitement and enthusiasm within the program . your support of events like this is incredibly valuable , and appreciated .
if you can join us , please rsvp to jackie coleman by email , or at extension x 54070 .
thank you ,
billy
