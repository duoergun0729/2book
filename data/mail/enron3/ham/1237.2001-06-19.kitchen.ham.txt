ken , jeff and louise ,
below please find links for the multimedia version of the harvard cases completed in final form last month . the text of the multimedia case is the same as that previously forwarded . i have reviewed these multimedia cases and they are very cool !
i will be forwarding releases to each of you for signature . please return the releases as soon as possible as meg wozny at harvard , with whom i ' ve been working on these for the past few months , is leaving hbs at the end of june - - i ' d like for her to have the satisfaction of finalizing this project before she leaves .
harvard reports that these cases are best sellers ! also , we enjoyed an " enron day " at harvard april 26 th ; it received such rave reviews that harvard has requested a similar event for this summer .
thanks to all of you for your participation and help !
