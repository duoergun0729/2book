Subject: origination to be granted to edem
louise , we have been pre - paying the positions to some of our customers . some of them have been selling swaps to get rid financially of the pemex fixed price contract , and then re - purchasing the swaps . in some cases they are asking to get pre - paid , so we call treasury and calculate the npv with the discoutn rate they give us ( usually enron ' s cost of funds ) .
however , i have been able to increase the discount rate in various cases , so that we offer a better alternative to the customer , than their own cost of funds . it has worked and i think we can increase our margins by keep on doing that .
questions : can we get credit for the origination on top of enron ' s treasury rate ? if so , with whom should i speak to get it granted to edem ?
best regards .
