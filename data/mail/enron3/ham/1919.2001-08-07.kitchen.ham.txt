Subject: holli krebs resigns
she tendered her resignation this morning . intends to sit out for noncompete period . don ' t think that she has secured a new job yet , but will likely show up with calpine or aep in portland sometime in q 4 . probably has a verbal commitment from wolfe to work with him wherever he lands . haven ' t had exit interview yet . most likely leaving due to money . hate to lose her , but foster and swerzbin are ok with it .
i will call wolfe today and tell him about holli and directly ask him if he is leaving based on this new information .
