Subject: remote office lease payments
louise ,
enron property has asked me to validate whether some of the remote office leases should be paid for january . i have been unable to get an answer about the denver office . will you please advise ?
we will still be able to reject the lease even if we pay the january rent , if we do so by feb . 2 under the bankruptcy rules .
thank you ,
tammy
