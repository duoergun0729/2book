Subject: ecs ski trip information
louise ,
per our discussion , you will find attached an itemized accounting ( from expense reports ) for the customer ski trip that andrew miles and john kiani from my group attended ( 3 / 27 / 01 - 4 / 1 / 01 ) in vail with two customers of iroquois pipeline who we have been working with to try and do a deal on their eastchester phase ii expansion . as for the link on the www . skihomerental . com website , i am at a loss . i have put a phone call into these people for an explanation and have asked for this link to be removed . i can only assume that this was set up when we were talking to the internal client entertainment group about using the " enron " beaver creek houses as the house descriptions look familiar . we declined to use their services as a trip of this magnitude would have cost closer to at least $ 12 , 000 ( for four people ) and we decided to scope one out independently . please let me know if this answers your questions and if i can be of further assistance .
thanks ,
chris hilgert
