louise ,
you treated me with a degree of candor and respect this morning that was really refreshing to me , although , i must admit that you caught me off - guard . if you give me the chance , i will be a leader in your organization . there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that i can generate the new ideas and the new business that you require of a top performing vice president . in fact i am dying to get a chance to prove to you that i can deliver results . i don ' t want to loose any more time than i already have ; i want to start now .
as you don ' t know well some of the people who ' s names i gave you as references , you might also want to try scott neal or don black . both of them know me quite well and would give you an opinion on my ability to deliver what you are looking for .
thank you for the opportunity .
