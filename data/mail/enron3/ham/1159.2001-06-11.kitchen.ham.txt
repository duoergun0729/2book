please let me know if you need detailed info on vesting .
the vested and unvested values were determined with a $ 51 . 00 current stock price . the values do include the grants provided on 1 / 22 / 01 . if you received any grants after 1 / 22 / 01 , i ' m not aware of them - - just let me know the grant date or other info and i ' ll get all the detailed info .

can you do me a favor when you have a minute , i am doing a will and need details of my stocks and options and i wanted to check out that i have everything included as i do not information on all of it ( particularly a recent tranche ) . can you email me a spreadsheet ( usual password ) or if that is too much of a problem just the nominal values of vested and unvested at current enron stock prices .
thanks
