Subject: tamsa proposal
i met yesterday with guillermo vogel , ceo of tamsa . ( 110 mw ) .
he was interested in receiving a proposal from enron , based on an import of power scheme .
he offered me to give us a quick response , on whether they are seriously interested .
he will be out of the country for two weeks , and told me he will be ready to review our deal then .
the steps are as follows :
1 ) mr gustavo rosas ( from their veracruz site ) will provide all the information we require .
he called me today , and is preparing the information . ( mr rosas phone no . 2989 - 1100 x 4006 )
2 ) marc should call mr rosas next monday 9 , confirm all the information that i requested ,
and schedule a visit to veracruz next week , since mr rosas wants to meet us there .
3 ) prepare a proposal with 10 and 15 years prices , that we should deliver in two weeks time .
so far , it looks promising .
