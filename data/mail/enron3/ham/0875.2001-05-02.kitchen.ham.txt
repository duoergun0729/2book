congratulations on closing the deal with formosa , teppco , et al . it sounds like it was a very complex negotiation with a number of different players .
clean fuels is certainly pleased with the new long term storage arrangement with formosa . we will begin working with them to better define the operating parameters ( timing , pressures , volumes , etc ) so we can develop the specific facility plans and cost estimates as necessary .
you had also mentioned that you might be willing to share the management presentation that was put together for this deal ? that would be very interesting reading and i would appreciate a copy if possible .
thanks again , john goodpasture
