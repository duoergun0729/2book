mike signed on friday which is great news . richter , heizenrader , and i are all waiting on language that gets us comfortable with the california litigation risk . in case you were wondering , we are not talking to one another about this language . each person is working independently on this . we have been waiting on michele cash for a week now on proposed language ( and for me , a copy of enron ' s corporate bylaws explaining officer indemnification ) . i will keep you posted .
