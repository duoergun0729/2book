> for your information , i have attached the current proformas ( ubs and
the standard ) . i know john and mike have had a lot of conversations on
this - essentially where we stand is that the work has been done to
complete the commercial reductions ( by name ) but the non - commercial
groups have just been reduced across the board and we intend to start
the process today on how to cut the numbers on the non - commercial side .
the theory was that communicating the netcolite concept was something
we would not do until we had a bit more clarity . webb knows but that ' s
about it on the non - commercial side .
