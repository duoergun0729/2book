Subject: re : so
going going gone - he was bitter and uncurable :
left calpine ( and a bunch of options ) 2 . 5 years ago
did great his first year
floundered last year
joined my group in january - felt like he got screwed by presto and jacoby
never got any traction in my group
he will be a better counterparty - left on good terms , not sure where he ' s going yet
