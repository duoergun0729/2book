Subject: california update - - 09 . 27 . 01
though there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding whether and when davis will call back the california legislature to address the edison mou , here ' s the latest information we have .
faced with horrible polling , an unwilling legislature , an uncooperative california puc , and a wily leader of the state senate ( burton ) , davis is now considering delaying any action to call back the legislature .
rumors of a delay come despite davis ' statements that he would call them back next week .
we received the information about a likely delay from an edison svp who ' s working with administration staff to come up with a deal that the legislature can finally swallow .
it ' s edison ' s view that the earliest davis would now call the legislature back is end of next week , with early the following week being most likely .
at this point , the chance remains that davis may be forced to throw up his hands and call the whole thing off , leaving edison to follow pg & e into chapter 11 .
in the meantime , negotiations between davis ' staff , and staff from the senate and assembly continue .
we ' ll report back with information as we get it .
best ,
