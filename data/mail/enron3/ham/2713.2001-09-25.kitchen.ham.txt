Subject: re : new york
these are the events that took place concerning the new york customer holiday event :
in order to reserve rooms for the first weekend in ny at the four seasons , i have to book no later than 9 months out .
to hold these rooms , a contract had to be signed and a $ 15 , 000 deposit sent . the contract allowed us to cancel the entire event by the end of july with no penalty and the deposit was fully refundable .
in speaking with dave duran and frank vickers in may , they wanted to proceed with this event . ( attached is a memo that i sent to frank vickers outlining the cancellation policy . )
the cost estimate went through several revisions and the final was sent to you for your approval in july .
after the approval form was rejected , i spoke with dave duran and he was planning to revise his guest list and re - submit the approval form .
i talked to both frank and dave numerous times and reminded them of the hotel penalty issues and had not heard back from either one until i received an e - mail on september 20 th from frank canceling his portion of the trip .
i called my four seasons national sales rep and she is working with ny in canceling the contract and minimizing the hotel liquidated damages . i should have an answer from her no later than tomorrow .
please let me know if you would like to discuss this in more detail .
thanks .
