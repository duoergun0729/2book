well . . .
due to calendar conflicts at utilicorp , their president , jim miller and the vice - president of the utilicorp utilities , gail mcminn , will not be together and execute documents until next monday , october 8 . the have an internal approval process similar to our dash and they could not get all parties to execution by today .
none of us like delays , but i remain extremely positive and assured on this transaction .
