Subject: california update - - 09 . 10 . 01
the senate rules committee just met . during the hearing , senate leader john burton stated that :
the senate intends to rewrite the version of the mou that the assembly approved last thursday night and sent over to the senate for final approval ( sb 78 ) .
the version of the mou that will emerge from the senate sometime this week will look much more like the bill that originally passed out of the senate prior to the july summer recess . that bill was unacceptable to edison and davis , which led to the version that the assembly developed and approved last thursday night .
if the senate proceeds as burton suggests , the chances are very low that an mou will make it through the legislature and get davis ' signature .
burton generally sticks to his word . but there is still time for additional negotiations and sb 78 could squeak by . however , burton ' s comments in the rules committee certainly don ' t help 78 ' s chances for survival .
finally , the assembly is currently debating the last surviving windfall profits bill , and the bill is having a hard time getting the votes necessary for passage . more information on the windfall profits bill as we get it .
best ,
