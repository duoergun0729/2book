Subject: doyle equity earnings loss
hi louise ,
to refresh your memory , ena ooc took a loss of ( $ 1 . 4 m ) in 2 nd quarter for doyle equity earnings per ben jacoby ' s request . he is to reimburse you upon the sale of this investment .
i am now told that he will not sell doyle until october . the 3 q forecasted loss for doyle is ( $ 662 k ) . should i again flash this loss in ooc , or to east development ( jacoby ) ? please advise . thanks !
