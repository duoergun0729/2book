Subject: marathon data request and update
louise ,
unfortunately we did not have an opportunity to meet this past wednesday . marathon will not give enron the opportunity to commercially manage marathon ashland ' s ( map ) assets which represents their refined products and crude divisions . unfortunately for us , at this time , map has done very well these past two years ( intrinsic position of short crude and long refined products ) to warrant being the " crown jewel " of marathon . however , they still want to pursue the " hydrocarbon desk " for all of their global upstream business . however , they have promised , based on the expected success from the business venture from enron , to approach the map board . also , marathon has assigned a second individual ( david risser ) to work on joint opportunities between enron and marathon .
as such , i have met with the appropriate representatives from power , natural gas and lng to put together a document clarifying our need to identify relevant data across these commodities . i have attached this data request and would appreciate your blessing of the document .
i want to send out this document , via email , to marathon late tomorrow morning .
regards , mrha
