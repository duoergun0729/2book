Subject: broker client
louise ,
i believe that if we want the broker client contracts to be a source of $ $ then we will need to wait and negotiate new contracts in several months after we reestablish a dominant position .
if we want the brokers to help us build liquidity immediately , we should give them the contracts for free - and pay them brokerage .
your thoughts ?
