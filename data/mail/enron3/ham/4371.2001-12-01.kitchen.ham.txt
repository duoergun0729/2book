Subject: fw : expense
my group has scrubbed the teams per your request and excluded items such as rent , outside legal costs , systems development , etc . if you look at the individual team tab towards the bottom of the spreadsheet you ' ll see the items that have been removed . we ' ve also adjusted other expenses for any unusual items that may have been coded there . please let me know if you ' d like for us to forecast 2002 expenses based on this information .
