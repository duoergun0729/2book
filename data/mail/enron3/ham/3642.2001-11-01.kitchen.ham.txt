new york ( afx ) - enron corp shares were sharply lower , down more than 8 pct at midsession , as investors continued to fear that the company ' s dealings with the ljm partnership could bring heavy financial reprisals following the opening of a formal inquiry by the securities and exchange commission , dealers said .
at 11 . 55 am , enron was down 1 . 35 usd , or 9 . 57 pct , to 12 . 55 .
the djia rose 61 . 23 points to 9 , 136 . 44 , the s & p 500 gained 8 . 76 points to 1 , 068 . 40 points , the nasdaq composite climbed 23 . 02 points to 1 , 713 . 40 .
yesterday , enron announced the election of william powers jr to the board , to chair a special committee that will examine and take any appropriate actions with respect to transactions between enron and entities connected to related parties .
in addition to reviewing the transactions in question , the special committee is charged with communicating with the sec and recommending any other actions it deems appropriate .
while the investigation might take time to draw a conclusion , the immediate cash crunch enron has been facing is expected to be resolved , said merrill lynch analyst duane grubert .
one step in that direction came following enron ' s announcement that jp morgan and salomon smith barney inc have executed commitment letters to provide 1 bln usd in secured credit lines supported by the company ' s northern natural gas and transwestern pipeline assets .
over time , enron has several other options to raise cash , including cutting its 400 mln usd per year dividend , cutting back on its 1500 mln usd of capital spending , and monetizing its july 2002 right to convert debt into 11 . 5 million shares of eog , said grubert .
the danger for the company now is that a " real or fabricated confidence crisis by enron ' s counterparties threatens near term strength of the merchant segment . competitors could get mean , and could prematurely shun enron , while trying to steal market share , " he said .

new york , nov 1 ( reuters ) - merrill lynch on thursday said it lowered both its mid - term and long - term ratings for enron corp . , the no . 1 buyer and seller of natural gas , to " neutral , " from " accumulate " and " buy , " respectively , due to uncertainty about the u . s . securities and exchange commission ' s investigation into the company ' s financial dealings .
analyst donato eassey said in a research note that while he " has not altered his view of enron ' s fundamentals or its ability to weather the long term storm , " he believes the noise surrounding the sec ' s investigation will overpower any earnings analysis .
" ultimate outcome and underlying fundamentals aside , we believe significant pressure and uncertainty will remain on enron until the investigation concludes , " eassey said .
the houston - based company , whose stock has been sent into a tailspin by the probe , said on wednesday the informal inquiry by the sec had become a full - scale investigation of the company ' s finances .
the stock slumped $ 1 . 34 , or nearly 10 percent , to $ 12 . 56 in thursday morning new york stock exchange trade . in the past week and a half , the stock has dropped to nine - year lows while losing $ 17 billion in market value .

enron obtains $ 1 billion in financing to bolster credit facilities
11 / 01 / 2001
dow jones business news
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
houston - - enron corp . said thursday it has secured commitments for an additional $ 1 billion in financing from units of j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . as the embattled energy trader moves to supplement its credit facilities .
" this is yet another step in our efforts to enhance market and investor confidence , " said enron chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon . " we are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating . "
enron has seen its stock price plummet in a selloff sparked by a loss of investor confidence in the company following big third - quarter write - downs and the disclosure of an inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . in morning trading on the new york stock exchange , enron ( ene ) shares were down $ 1 . 67 , or 12 % , to $ 12 . 23 . the stock has declined from a 52 - week high of $ 84 . 88 .
enron ' s new financing is secured by its northern natural gas co . and transwestern pipeline co . assets .
the financing news comes a day after the sec elevated to a formal investigation its inquiry into enron ' s financial dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow . a formal investigation involves the sec ' s enforcement branch going to the five - member commission and obtaining formal subpoena power to pursue its inquiry .
enron last week disclosed that the sec had contacted the company as part of what it described as an informal inquiry into the fastow - related partnerships . at the time , enron said it welcomed the inquiry and that it would cooperate fully with the sec - - a position the company has restated repeatedly since .
in turn , enron named william power a director and head of a four - member committee to look into the fastow - related transactions and other matters . power is dean of the university of texas school of law .
enron has consistently said its dealings with the fastow - connected partnerships were legal and properly disclosed to investors . according to enron filings with the sec , the company did deals involving billions of dollars of assets and enron stock with entities related to the fastow partnerships . internal partnership documents indicate that mr . fastow and possibly others made millions of dollars from the partnerships . mr . fastow , who was replaced as chief financial officer by mr . mcmahon last week , has consistently declined to be interviewed .

houston ( ap ) - troubled enron corp . said thursday it has secured $ 1 billion in new financing , using its natural gas and pipeline assets as collateral . but its stock price took another dive after rising a day earlier on takeover speculation .
in afternoon trading thursday on the new york stock exchange , enron shares were down 9 . 3 percent , or $ 1 . 29 a share , at $ 12 . 61 .
after dropping to a nine - year low on tuesday , shares of the nation ' s largest natural gas and power marketer rose 25 percent wednesday amid speculation the houston - based company was a takeover candidate .
but after the stock market closed for the day , enron announced the securities and exchange commission had opened a formal investigation into possible conflicts of interest .
the sec is apparently looking into dealings enron had with partnerships led by its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow , who was forced out last month as investors fled because of questions about the arrangements .
on thursday , enron announced its investment bankers had arranged for $ 1 billion in fresh credit lines that it planned to use partly to refinance maturing debts .
" this is yet another step in our efforts to enhance market and investor confidence , " said jeffrey mcmahon , enron ' s new chief financial officer . " we are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating . "
late wednesday , enron said it created a special committee headed by university of texas law school dean william powers to respond to the sec investigation . powers also was elected to enron ' s board of directors .
" i have asked the board to take this action to address fully and forthrightly investors ' questions and concerns , " said enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l . lay . " we will also make every appropriate public disclosure during the course of the sec ' s investigation . "
however , duane grubert , an analyst with sanford c . bernstein and co . in new york , said enron still has much to do to restore investor confidence .
" with ( stock ) values this low , you ' ve got two camps of investors : guys that hate enron and guys that want to be cautiously attracted to enron , " grubert said . " it ' s led to the trading range being irrationally low and shares being oversold . it ' s not something the company wants . "
enron ' s stock has skidded since the company reported a $ 638 million third quarter loss just over two weeks ago , dragged down by a one - time charge of $ 1 . 01 billion attributed to various losses . some of these losses have been tied to partnerships managed by fastow , who was ousted last week .
earlier this week , moody ' s investors service downgraded the company ' s long - term debt and warned of possible further downgrades .
since reporting its disappointing third quarter , enron had been negotiating to establish new credit lines .
carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities inc . in houston , said wednesday ' s stock price surge , after two weeks of selling , was likely a reaction to a the wall street journal report on rumors of a possible takeover of enron .
others might have been buying figuring the stock had hit bottom , she said .
on tuesday , enron ' s stock closed at $ 11 . 16 , its lowest level since 1992 .
potential buyers include general electric ' s ge capital unit , warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway and royal dutch shell , the journal said .

enron gets new bank loans but its bonds fall further

new york - ( dow jones ) - word that enron corp . ( ene ) had secured $ 1 billion in fresh funds thursday did little to soothe prices on the company ' s outstanding debt securities .
similar to other companies like lucent technologies inc . ( lu ) that have faced short - term liquidity issues this year , enron was forced to put up its assets in order to secure the financing . and the new bank facilities leapfrogged in front of other creditors like senior unsecured lenders .
the houston - based energy and trading company said in a statement thursday that the new financing is supported by enron ' s northern natural gas company and transwestern pipeline company assets . jpmorgan and salomon smith barney were co - arrangers on the credit lines .
enron plans to use the proceeds to supplement short - term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations . the new $ 1 billion of secured credit lines with the more than $ 1 billion in cash currently on the balance sheet " will further solidify enron ' s standing as the leading market maker in wholesale energy markets , " kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive officer , said in the statement .
but the need to pledge assets to get the credit lines shows caution on the part of lenders that ' s understandable given enron ' s situation , said susan abbott , a managing director in corporate finance at moody ' s investors service .

enron gets $ 1 bln loan to boost cash , credit rating ( update 3 )
( adds possibility of additional loans in 12 th paragraph . )
houston , nov . 1 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the largest
energy trader , received a $ 1 billion loan from j . p . morgan chase &
co . and salomon smith barney inc . after agreeing to use the
company ' s natural - gas pipelines as collateral .
proceeds will go for debt payments and to supplement enron ' s
short - term cash reserves . assets of enron ' s northern natural gas
co . and transwestern pipeline co . will secure the loan .
the financing comes a day after enron said the u . s .
securities and exchange commission is formally investigating
partnerships run by its former chief financial officer . using the
pipelines as collateral signals enron ' s desperation to reassure
shareholders and trading partners that it is creditworthy ,
investors said .
` ` its not reassuring , it ' s worrisome , ' ' said donald coxe ,
manager of the harris insight equity fund , which owns about 78 , 000
enron shares . ` ` if they had to secure the loan , obviously the
lenders don ' t think they can rely on enron ' s financial
statements . ' '
shares of enron fell $ 1 . 35 , or 9 . 7 percent , to $ 12 . 55 in late
morning trading . earlier , they dropped to $ 11 . 47 . before today ,
the shares had fallen 83 percent this year .
enron ' s shares fell 52 percent last month amid an sec inquiry
into partnerships headed by andrew fastow , enron ' s former chief
financial officer , that cost $ 35 million and $ 1 . 2 billion in lost
shareholder equity . a formal sec investigation began yesterday .
` ` it seems until we know more about the sec investigation ,
it ' s going to be a difficult time for the stock , ' ' said tara
gately , an energy analyst at loomis sayles & co . , which sold most
of its enron shares early last year .
pipeline as collateral
enron , based in houston , got its start as a gas - pipeline
company . in the past decade , chairman kenneth lay has transformed
the company into the biggest trader of electricity , natural gas ,
forest products and other commodities . enron accounts for about a
quarter of u . s . power and natural gas trades .
northern natural gas , enron ' s largest pipeline , has
approximately 16 , 500 miles of pipeline from the permian basin in
texas to the great lakes . transwestern pipeline spans about 2 , 500
miles .
since the sec began its inquiry , concerns about shaky
finances have prevented enron from selling commercial paper , or
short - term ious . the financing is to ` ` enhance market and investor
confidence , ' ' enron chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon said
in a statement .
` ` we are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet
and maintain our investment grade credit rating ' ' mcmahon said .
enron can borrow another $ 200 million by bringing other banks
into the loan , spokeswoman karen denne said . ` ` we don ' t have any
plans to do so at this point , ' ' she said .
credit rating
on monday , moody ' s investors service lowered enron ' s long -
term credit rating to ` ` baa 2 ' ' from ` ` baal , ' ' two notches above
junk status . it also placed the company ' s ` ` p - 2 ' ' rating for
commercial paper on review for possible downgrade .
falling below investment grade would trigger early repayment
terms for affiliated companies enron formed to buy its assets such
as power plants . the affiliates plan to repay borrowed money by
selling the assets . enron might have to repay any difference
between what the assets sell for and the underlying debt .
j . p . morgan is advising enron on the sale of part of its
azurix north america water business to american water works inc .
for $ 148 . 8 million in cash and assumed debt . salomon smith barney
is the investment banking arm of citigroup inc .

indian financial institutions fail to resolve dabhol power issue

new delhi , nov 1 asia pulse - financial institutions led by the industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) have failed to come up with a solution to the long payment dispute with united states energy company enron that has forced the closing of the us $ 2 . 9 billion dabhol power project .
top officials of idbi and icici met officials in the finance and power ministries here today but failed to come up with an " optimum " solution .
" we discussed enron . the discussions are continuing and we are examining various options , " idbi chairman p p vora told reporters after meeting power secretary a k basu .
he said the fis , which have a total exposure of over rs 62 billion in the project , wanted to come up with a optimum solution but declined to give a time frame for it .
earlier in the day , vora met finance minister yashwant sinha to apprise him about the situation .
fis had decided to come up with a solution by oct 31 for the second phase of the 2 , 184 mw dabhol power company ( dpc ) .
a settlement of the enron imbroglio , being played out since early this year , assumes importance in view of prime minister atal bihari vajpayee ' s forthcoming visit to washington where he is likely to have wide ranging discussions with us president george bush .
enron was the biggest donor to bush ' s presidential electoral campaign .
so far , tata power and bses ltd . were in the fray for buying enron ' s stake in dpc .
although the companies showed reluctance to buy enron ' s stake at the price spelled out by the us power giant , vora said the two companies are still in the fray .

india : sci to inject more funds into greenfield shipping

business line ( the hindu )
fin . times info ltd - asia africa intel wire . business line ( the hindu ) copyright ( c ) 2001 kasturi & sons ltd . all rights res ' d
new delhi , oct . 31 after several rounds of discussions and consultations within its board and with the ministry of shipping , the shipping corporation of india ( sci ) has finally decided to pump in $ 13 million as additional investment in greenfield shipping company to part - fund the gap in project cost of $ 55 million for building an lng tanker for transporting gas to dabhol power company .
" the shipping ministry has given its in - principle approval to sci for investing an extra $ 13 million in greenfield which will be in the form of a loan to the company and not as extra equity . the additional investment by sci would not require clearance from the union cabinet , " government sources told business line .
though the additional investment of $ 55 million is to be shared equally by the three promoters of greenfield in proportion to their equity holdings , this proposition has gone awry due to the fact that one of the promoters , enron - affiliate atlantic commercial inc with a 20 per cent stake , has clearly said no to putting its share of extra funds .
in fact , atlantic commercial inc . is understood to have expressed a desire to exit from greenfield by selling its equity worth $ 11 million and the swap cost of $ 19 million .
consequently , the extra investment of atlantic commercial inc of $ 11 million is being shared by the other two partners - sci and japan ' s mitsui o . s . k . lines - apart from their own share of the additional cost in proportion to their equity holdings of 20 per cent and 60 per cent respectively .
so , sci will put in an additional $ 13 million comprising its share of $ 11 million and $ 2 million of atlantic commercial ' s share . whereas , mol will pump - in an additional $ 42 million including its share of $ 33 million and $ 9 million of atlantic ' s share .
the additional investment by the promoters of greenfield shipping company has become necessary after the bankers to the lng shipping deal led by anz investment bank had suspended disbursement of the last tranche of the project loan of $ 55 million , citing an event of default .
the additional investment made by sci and mol will take the form of a loan to greenfield which would enable the company to take possession of the lng tanker on the scheduled delivery date of november 15 .
greenfield was formed for owning an operating a 137 , 000 cubic metre capacity tanker for transporting lng to enron - promoted dabhol power plant . the tanker is ready for delivery at the yard of mitsubishi , japan .
the promoters are negotiating with oman lng to deploy the lng tanker ' lng laxmi ' till the lng terminal of dabhol goes on stream .

enron and the curse of drexel
commentary : energy trader ' s friends dry up
by david callaway > , cbs . marketwatch . com
last update : 1 : 15 am et nov . 1 , 2001
san francisco ( cbs . mw ) - - it was the master of its universe .
its employees were rich , young and ruthless . it treated its clients and rivals alike , with disdain . its leader counseled business tycoons and political powerbrokers alike . and when the bottom finally fell out , it didn ' t have a friend in the world to save it .
wall street loves a success story . but it loves a success story gone wrong even more . such was the case for drexel burnham lambert , the junk bond empire of the 1980 s , whose spiritual leader michael milken orchestrated one of the greatest financial shell games of all time before it collapsed in a heap of federal investigations , losses and the largest bankruptcy in wall street history .
for enron , the energy trading giant that has seen its shares lose more than two - thirds of their value this month amid questions about its financial transactions and its stability , the similarities are striking .
like drexel , enron set out to change an industry . like drexel , it succeeded , for a while . under the guidance of chairman ken lay , enron evolved from a backwater texas natural - gas pipeline company to become the nation ' s largest energy merchant .
its enrononline business transformed the way energy trading was done and funneled hundreds of billions of dollars in transactions through the company in last two years . the aggressive trading philosophy geared to squeezing a profit at all costs made millionaires of many employees , while those who were not deemed worthy simply vanished from the trading rooms , no questions asked . enron was and is the dark star of the energy industry .
for his part , lay became an international corporate celebrity , advising president bush on his campaign and taking a lead role with vice president dick cheney on the administration ' s controversial energy plan earlier this year .
but enron ' s attempt to extend its dominance into the telecom industry and its secretive financial structure finally got the best of it . the unexplained resignation of its chief executive in august , the ouster of its chief financial officer last week and the company ' s inability to prove its financial health have prompted investors to bail out of enron stock like jackrabbits escaping a brushfire .
now lay & co . are busy trying to raise cash from a skeptical wall street that is starting to admit it never understood the business in the first place ( sound familiar ? ) . takeover speculation gave enron shares a boost wednesday , helping it end a 10 - day losing streak . but it ' s unlikely anyone is going to step into this mess before a securities and exchange commission investigation into its finances yields a few more answers .
for investors , a short - term rally beyond the jump wednesday is still possible now that all of the big mutual funds have dumped the shares . but at a closing price of $ 13 . 90 , enron shares are more than a texas mile from their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 88 last december .
for enron itself , it ' s time to put its cards on the table with regulators and wall street . as the drexel saga showed , a strategy of defiance to the end only hastens the end .
