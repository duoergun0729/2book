Subject: abb
enron canada may be close to selling the abb units for over $ 35 mm . please refrain from offering a lower price to brokers , consultants , etc . on these units for a week . we should still mention them as available and should still work on putting them on eol ( if this party is real , it might be slick to have them close the transaction electronically ! ) .
