per your request , i will start providing a daily status report on the wind ppa mtm value . as of the close of thurs . 9 / 13 , the ppa value was approx . $ 24 . 0 mm ( after reserves ) . when i receive the $ 100 mm guaranty cost i will start incorporating this into a net calculation for an enron corp . view of the value .
