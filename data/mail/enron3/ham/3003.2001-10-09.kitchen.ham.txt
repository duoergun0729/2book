Subject: budget
louise ,
i ' ve seen a list where you nominate a set of business sponsors to represent na interests , and it appears that the intention is to have single points of contact for each of the budget buckets .
however , there are a number of horizontal initiatives , such as global data , that cut across all of them .
is it your intention that we take the horizontals to all the people listed , or will you nominate one to evaluate the budget numbers ?
regards
steve
