fyi - we negotiated a unilateral management out through next friday so i suspect there will be some internal discussion about the toll early next week . since chip and brian were plugged in every step of the way i hope we wont try to reneg on the deal , but if we made a big mistake late last night we could go back to allegheny . should not be a problem , but thought you should know .
