Subject: draft 6 th floor layout
attached is the first draft of the 6 th floor plan . if you are fundamentally in agreement with the locations of these groups , we ' ll ask department leads to put final names on seats .
the 5 th floor would accomodate it , accounting and energy op ' s ( excluding logistics / scheduling ) .
phase one will include moving estate people off the floors - best case tues / weds pm .
phase two will include moving the people already on these floors to new locations - best case weds / thurs .
phase three will include moving people from the enron north building over - best case to be determined .
regards ,
tammy
