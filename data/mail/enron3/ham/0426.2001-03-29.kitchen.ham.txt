Subject: internal ownership of enron americas assets
i have suggested a slightly edited version of the draft policy . i think classifying assets qualifying for transfer as " problem " and / or " orphan " may clarify the criteria . also , i am assuming that the intent is to except energy capital resources assets from the policy and have so indicated . on the other hand , as written , the policy would apply to principal investing assets .
