raj vaswani , the general counsel for kiodex , called me to pass along two messages :
1 . if a new joint venture is created to resurrect enrononline , kiodex would be interested in pursuing a business relationship with the new joint venture . i told him that it was much too early to predict whether this would be of interest to a new trading company , but i told him i would relay kiodex ' s interest to you .
2 . kiodex may be interested in repurchasing the shares in kiodex currently owned by enron net works llc . he did not know what the price would be , but wanted to know if we would be interested . since net works is a filed company , we would probably have to get the bankruptcy court ' s approval to sell . i assume that if the price is right we are interested in pursuing this . let me know .
thanks , anne
