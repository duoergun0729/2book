Subject: eol
i am running out to my daughter ' s school , but i think we are done .
jay webb is fine with the new set up with savita reporting to me on a temporary basis and brad working to get ready to take the job like andy used to have it and the reporting going to brad eventually . i think he is actually relieved and really wants to focus on building a larger career in technology and pickering is very supportive of giving jay a larger enw role in ecommerce . jay is also committed to signing a new contract .
savita is talking to jay right now and if that goes ok , savita is done as well . i told jay that i was doing this so there should not be any issues . jay told me he would absolutely support savita as he did when andy was in charge . she is ready to support the deal until year end and help me hire and train the next wave of eol folks as well as get brad ready .
richter is committed as well . he feels the origination part is tactical and a short run project and wants to run the system like andy used to .
savita will get with me tomorrow first thing and i think seal it . we all want to wait until next week when pickering is here to make it public knowledge .
have no idea if egm knows any of this .
your thoughts ?
