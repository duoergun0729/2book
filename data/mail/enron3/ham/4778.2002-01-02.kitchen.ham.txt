Subject: netco implemention template
from kevin presto :
attached is the spreadsheet version of the template we discussed this morning . i have added the additional columns everyone requested . i would now like the business unit leads to fill in the blanks such that we have an initial power implementation plan that can be delivered to louise on friday .
with respect to east power ( i am out thursday and friday ) , i am delegating to all of my desk heads the responsibility the following :
1 ) have all of the forms attached spreadsheet forms complete
2 ) a product offering sheet is added to the template .
fletch & dana - please take the lead on creating the product offering list ( physical and financial ) . my recommendation is we put products out through 03 for all regions ( financial and physical ) . obviously , the physical products will be contingent on receiving a power marketing license .
cory and don baughman - please take a crack at identifying all of the transmission service agreements we need for the east ( christi has started a list already ) .
the transmission agreement list attached can be used to prioritize or assign commercial people to transmission / pool agreements . it is not correct on the timing under the pools , so don ' t rely on that column .
please call me on my cell ( 713 - 856 - 3923 ) with any questions .
