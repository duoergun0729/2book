here is the latest . . . . . .
senator burton spoke with the speaker last night and urged him not to convene an assembly session during the scheduled recess , since the senate is not going to interrupt their vacation . burton ' s request , in conjunction with the speaker ' s trouble in getting enough of his members to return on their own dime ( he didn ' t want the assembly to pay for people to fly back from european vacations for 48 hours - and few members were willing to pay for it themselves ) , means there will probably not be a hearing on hertzberg ' s edison bailout plan tomorrow .
since hertzberg plan is different from the bill the senate passed , burton wants hertzberg to include the senate in discussions on a solution that can get passed in both houses . since it is not expected to be any hearing on any bills / edison bailout before both houses return from the summer recess on august 20 th - we look for negotiations to occur on extending the mou ' s aug 15 th deadline .
