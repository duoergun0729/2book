subject : please reply by wednesday , 8 / 22 - - draft rehearing request - - ferc reporting requirements for california sales
attached is a draft of our rehearing request on the order ferc issued in rmol - 9 requiring sellers of gas into california to file information on their sales , transport , and purchases . the rehearing request restates our arguments in response to the nopr that ( 1 ) permanent , formal reporting requirements are not appropriate to address a temporary problem and are beyond the scope of the commission ' s powers under the natural gas act and ( 2 ) the commission significantly underestimated the burden of the reporting requirements as well as the responding parties ' ability to comply . we also request that the reports , if they must be submitted , be due 45 days after the end of the month instead of the required 30 days .
please provide any comments or suggestions you may have on this draft to either myself ( 713 - 853 - 5840 ) or leslie ( 505 - 623 - 6778 ) by cob wednesday ( 8 / 22 ) .
thanks .
