Subject: contract proposals
you should have recently received an e - mail from amy fitzpatrick with proposed contract numbers for most of the people in my group . i have met with each person on my staff to discuss ballpark numbers . i don ' t have definitive offers from anyone , nor have i shown them definitive bids . however , i have asked each person to provide me with a ballpark value that they would be willing to do . on an encouraging note , the ballpark values were in line with what we ultimately offered crandall . however , these values are significantly above the " standard proposal " put forth earlier . i would very much like to get these guys done without forcing them into the painful shopping process . i think these numbers get us there and are consistent with what i believe to be " market " for west power traders , as is evidenced by sean crandall .
i would like to set up a meeting to discuss asap . perhaps david should figure out a time for us to get together to talk through the spreadsheet .
