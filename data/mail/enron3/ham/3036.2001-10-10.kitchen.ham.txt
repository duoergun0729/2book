Subject: tech services
i spoke with wayne mays - he spoke with coleman and virgo and confirmed my understanding : wayne ' s rc has the following people :
portland :
bill williams - development
mark mullen - development
larry soderquist - transmission
stan gray - transmission
don hamond - transmission
jodi blackburn - contracts
patty deas - admin
houston :
walter koffer - transmission
most of walter koffer ' s work is for the east , but wayne pays for him because :
- the other transmission people are part of wayne ' s world ;
- west occassionally borrows people from virgo - ( 1 person for two weeks , 2 people 2 hours a day for 3 months , etc . ) and uses approximately one person - year .
this totals 9 people for the west - one less than a moth ago ( kraszewski already left the company ) . no one else should be charged to the west . the west should not be used for arguing the existence of other technical people in the east . my budget will show 8 people for tech services which means that i intend to reduce by one more - likely to occur in ql .
