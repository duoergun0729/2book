calling it an error is unfair . i am not prepared to offer her and her husband a job by friday . she concedes that her role on the power side may be project - like and therefore short - term . i will keep in touch with her and open the door later . london is being freaky about people finding homes asap , and it doesn ' t match my timeframe .

as i said in the note of yesterday - i have no interest in having the meeting . my assistant is away so its just a misunderstanding . see yesterday ' s note , we are going in on monday .
i think losing amita is a major error . there are no other candidates in the organisation with her expertise apart from zipper , forster and savita .
thanks

i saw that our friday meeting got rescheduled until next week , after your budget meeting with ooc . i ' d be interested to know what number you ' ll be assuming from eol in those discussions . i got your email , by the way . . . we ' re putting a little more thought into it than that .
also , amita is going to accept a project job with uk power . she needs an answer by friday on her and her husband ' s jobs . having not spoken to any other candidates but her at this point , i can ' t commit that soon . we ' ll keep in touch with her on the off chance that her power job is short term and she still wants to come to houston .
