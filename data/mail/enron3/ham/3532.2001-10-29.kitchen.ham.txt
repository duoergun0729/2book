louise :
a termination of equipment associated with the longview project on or before 10 / 31 / 01 will require enron to write - off approximately $ 23 million , not inclusive of approximately $ 3 million in development costs to date .
to extend orders for equipment to 11 / 30 / 01 will cost an additional $ 5 . 3 million in cancellation charges .
to extend orders for equipment to 12 / 31 / 01 will cost an additional $ 8 . 7 million ( inclusive of the $ 5 . 3 million above , therefore , net $ 3 . 4 million ) in cancellation charges .
termination at any time between now and year - end 2001 provides no material recovery potential for money spent .
