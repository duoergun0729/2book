fyi .
1 . charles yeung has decided to leave the company . he was in the ercot box support doug gilbert - smith .
2 . i met with ubs counsel today to discuss ferc and other licensing issues . i am scheduled to meet with bob dinerstein ( sp ? ) sometime tomorrow to discuss the function and some other administrative issues .
3 . we continue to gather tariffs , etc . to process the forms as soon as possible . of course , the ability to sell physical power will be contingent upon ferc approval of netco ' s mbr authority .
4 . i have postponed the ferc meeting scheduled for thursday until sometime next week . i still believe that it is appropriate to meet with ferc post - bankruptcy court approval ( maybe hsr approval ? ) .
thanks ,
jim
