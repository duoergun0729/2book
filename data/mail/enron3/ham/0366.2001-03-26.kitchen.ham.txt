Subject: fountain valley
we had a bad accident at the construction site on friday . a construction worker slipped and fell in front of a bulldozer . over the weekend he had his foot amputated . we have flown his family in and put them up at a ronald mcdonald house ( non - profit institution for families of injured / ill patients ) . the worker was employed by a sub - contractor of cig , the pipeline company that is constructing the gas lateral for fountain valley power llc .
nepco is making some noise because they want it to be clear that this was not a nepco subcontractor and therefore not nepco responsibility . we do not think this will materially delay closing the sale to black hills , but we will likely need to indemnify them from the litigation risk associated with this accident . we are working with legal and insurance to assess risk and process .
