Subject: another ees example
in march , mark bernstein of ees asked us not to contact egi ( pa utility ) as they were " doing a deal with them " .
after waiting for about two months , we contacted ugi as part of a general sweep of utilities to introduce our new wholesale services team . at that time , it became apparant that ees had been offering them a full requirements transaction . i am told that ugi is not in a deregulated area where it would be possible to pass individual customers over to another entity and when we met with them , they stated that they had no intention of passing any of their customers to any other entity .
as a sidenote , since that meeting , ees was apparantly very annoyed that we " screwed up their deal " with ugi ( presumably by meeting with them ) . rumour has it a conversation took place between dave delainey and dave duran on this subject , but i have not confirmed the details with dave duran yet .
