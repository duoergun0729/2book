Subject: interest rates
john / louise -
given that under the current plan , the bank will be trading our interest rate risk , i doubt we are taking an interest rate trader to newco . in order to get the books run we will need an interest rate curve .
should i plan on just getting access to reuters and setting a curve off of libor on my own ?
