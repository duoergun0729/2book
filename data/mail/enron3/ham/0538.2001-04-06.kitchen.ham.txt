ben ,
i have heard through the grape vine that concerns were raised this morning at your staff meeting about the allegheny closing . just to clarify , we have set may 3 , 2001 as the closing date . on that date we should receive $ 1 , 028 , 000 . 00 plus $ 10 - 15 million for reimbursement of some cost associated with a build out of a sub station .
let me know if you have any other questions .
regards ,
