louise ,
as i mentioned in our meeting today , attached is a map with a general description of orion ' s assets . given the location of astoria , i am sure we would find it interesting . however , it is generally understood in the market that goldman is selling the company ( not assets ) .
i got to know these guys pretty well last year when we ( delainey and i ) spent some talking with them about a jv with our peakers . let me know if you have any questions .
