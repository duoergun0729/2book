the biweekly april 13 th report is on its way to you . i would like to draw your attention to the status summaries for ihi and canfibre . ihi and canfibre are second to none in the portfolio as quagmires in which we have had to manufacture any bit of leverage to protect enron ' s interests . these companies have been extremely uncooperative and more often than not have been working adversely to enron . we are in the position of playing poker with absolutely nothing whatsoever " in the hole " . normally i try to highlight credit to the appropriate individuals in special assets when a transaction actually closes . in both these cases , however , i would like to make you aware that john enerson is doing an excellent job handling the deal complexities and applying persuasion , strong - arm , threats and any and all other methods to optimize value . there is not a lot of glamor working these turkeys . nothing is certain until we have cash in the bank , but i believe we may be seeing a little light at the end of the tunnel where there had been only abyss . john deserves a great deal of credit . dick .
