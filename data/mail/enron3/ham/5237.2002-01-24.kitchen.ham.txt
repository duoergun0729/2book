Subject: company name
louise ,
there seems to be some confusion over this , but i would like to proceed as follows . please let me know if you disagree :
1 ) for all contracts , " ubs ag , london branch " will be used ( online / offline , license applications , regulatory approvals , etc . )
2 ) for all marketing purposes , ubs warburg energy , llc will be used ( letterhead , brochures , etc . )
3 ) when using ubs warburg energy , llc , we will include small print along the lines of : " ubs warburg energy llc is a wholly owned subsidiary of ubs ag , london branch " ( i am confirming the wording and concept with legal ) .
thanks ,
dave
