hi greg ,
just to make sure we are on the same page . here is what we came up with finally
i will report to you and stay on at least till the end of this year . in the meantime we will work on getting some more people trained in the operations area . brad will assume andy ' s role at enrononline by the end of this year . brad and i will work with the traders to prioritize functionality requests . at the end of the year i will have to option to move on to do something different .
all this will be effective tuesday since jay wants to wait for mark pickering to return . finally this has louise , john and your support .
