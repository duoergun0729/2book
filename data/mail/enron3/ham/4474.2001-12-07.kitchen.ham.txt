subject :
guys , it has come to my attention that there is some discussion to move critical retail risk management and structuring personnel ( rogers herndon , dale furrow , don black , bernie aucoin , edith cross , etc ) into netco before complete discharge of duties from the retail organization . it is my expectation that this discharge will not occur until the all ees retail risk contracts are valued and discharged ( termination or sale ) in an orderly fashion that maximizes value to the estate . after completion of this effort , these people will be available to the corporation to move to whatever effort you deem appropriate . i would expect this to take the next four weeks .
thanks
