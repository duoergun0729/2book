Subject: natural gas origination
our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers . in order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth , we are making the following changes :
producer / wellhead group
the current mid - market , origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the central and eastern gas regions will be consolidated with the derivatives group under fred lagrasta . this will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the eastern u . s . the producer focus in the western u . s . and texas will remain unchanged reporting to mark whitt and brian redmond respectively .
strategic asset development
laura luce will move from her role in the central region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long - term strategic arrangements within the central and eastern regions . this initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development , asset management and optimization . this effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads .
central origination and mid - market
frank vickers will continue his current role in the eastern region and will assume the leadership role for mid - market and origination activity in the central region .
there will be no changes to the west and texas origination groups headed respectively by barry tycholiz and brian redmond .
please join us in congratulating fred , laura and frank in their new roles .
