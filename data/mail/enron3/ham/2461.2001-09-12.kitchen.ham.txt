Subject: approval of tasking letter
louise ,
i left you a tasking letter for approval last week for your signature . have you had a chance to sign it or do you have any questions ? we are now out of approved funding for eos activities without approval of this tasking letter .
in the past , brian redmond was the approver for ena , but he referred these to you going forward . if this is not correct , please let me know .
thanks !
mike
