Subject: allegheny status
after your and my conversation this am , our legal team had meeting with allegheny ' s .
meeting went well .
insurance still open , but we developed what should be a path to agt . other two major issues ( remedies under default and legal venue ) along with numerous minor issues were hopefully on way to being solved . docs to be exchanged again tonite . we ' ll see .
since that meeting , new issue arose re letter agt . it dealt with ensuring that the agts made by epmi in ltr agt re collateral were final once allegheny gave us notice that they were ok with security agts . issue not substantive and we will agree to their change . trying to get date of ltr agt to be today .
