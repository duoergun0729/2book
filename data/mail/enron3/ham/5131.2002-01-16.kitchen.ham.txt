subject : re - allocaton of $ ' s
i would like to recommend to following allocations of retention $ ' s - this creates no net impact on total $ ' s on the spreadsheet
gain 575 cash 450 equity ( rogers herndon , john forney , joe wagner , tom may )
re - allocate in the following manner :
cash equity
arora + 75 k + 75 k
gilb - smith + 25 k + 25 k
king + 25 k + 25 k
gupta + 25 k + 25 k
misra + 75 k + 75 k
suarez + 50 k + 50 k
carson + 25 k + 25 k
imai + 25 k + 25 k
steffes + 50 k + 50 k ( we will lose key reg people if we don ' t pay )
nicolay + 50 k + 50 k ( " " " )
novosel + 25 k + 25 k ( " " " )
please call with any questions . i feel very good about keeping nearly all of these people at the levels above and we could lose some key ones if we don ' t do this .
again , i am not spending any additional $ ' s - i am simply taking from other people who will not be part of ubs .
