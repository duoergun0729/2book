dwr : waiting on pro - forma financials and new agreement between dwr and puc that better secures credit . bonds just got approved - 90 day wait . negotiating eei for short term deals as well . dwr bid has $ 80 mm over mid , but i appear to be only one that thinks we should do a term deal with dwr . i will stay on top of this - these guys are the new big player in the market .
roseville : rac has recommended approval and we are circulating for signature . payment of $ 6 mm to georgia pacific for erc ' s due next week . balance of $ 43 mm to be spent over next 18 months . calpine and allegheny want to buy in - its a little early , but we might explore that in q 4 or ql 02 .
roseville prepay : someone else ( calpine or duke ) was more aggressive on the np - 15 term commodity offer so we are out - our best offer was mids + $ 5 ; someone else offfered at our mids . we are trying to see if we can partrner with the winner since our bid for cash may be higher .
