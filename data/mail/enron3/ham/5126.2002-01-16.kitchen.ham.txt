louise ,
- ubs is planning to tell all of those who are offered positions to come to work at the houstonion on friday , not at the enron building . at the houstonian , they will have a series of presentations on the new company . i raised concerns about this last night :
- having the ubs offerees offsite means that everyone left in the building is effectively told they are not a first - round pick .
- those who remain in the building will have little to do but sit and feed off each other ' s discontent .
- some of the initial offerees may refuse , in which case we then have to go back to a discontent estate person to offer them a position . this makes it very obvious to them and all their peers that they were a second - round draft choice .
i have suggested that they either accelerate the contracting process so we know that we have everyone before friday , or else delay the friday meeting . the friday meeting was stated as necessary so that everyone could understand their benefits before signing . this doesn ' t sound like a good reason to me .
- i am told i will be approached today by someone from ubs hr . i assume this is what you warned me about and that my " real " contract / meeting will be with you .
- ubs wants me to sign before they offer positions to others within enrononline . this doesn ' t make sense , but if true , can we meet as soon as possible ? i ' d like to make sure my people have their offers asap ( for the above reasons ) , but i ' d also like a little time to think about the offer you have in mind for me .
- i remain concerned that the people who were previously offered retention bonuses will be in a position to walk away at the end of feb . we are in a position where the critical people will be free to go , while the less critical people are incentivised to stay for 6 months .
