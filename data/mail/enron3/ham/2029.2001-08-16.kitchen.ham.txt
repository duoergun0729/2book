Subject: draft decision would end direct access effective sept 1
i only have a hard copy but i am faxing one to jim steffes . here is the relevant language .
p . 4 : " the legislature has directed this commission to suspend direct access until dwr no longer procures power for the retail end - users , and we find it should be suspended effective september 1 . "
there will be no hearing ( p . 6 ) " . . . we are simply implementing a clearly worded statue ( sic ) that directs the commission to suspend direct access . "
p . 7 findings of fact
" 3 . the right to contract for direct access should be suspended effective september 1 , 2001 , except for written contracts executed prior to september 1 , 2001 . "
p . 7 , conclusions of law
" 2 . the right to contract for direct access should be suspended effective september 1 , 2001 , except for written contracts executed prior to september 1 , 2001 . "
also some rhetoric ( p . 6 ) : " this is the time when large customers might be tempted to switch from utility bundled service to energy service providers in order to avoid some of the impact of higher rates . . . this is precisely the wrong time to encourage such behavior . "
p . 5 it also states that it will not address the payment of px credits - - and has bifurcated the issue from this order .
