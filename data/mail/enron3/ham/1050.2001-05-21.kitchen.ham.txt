dear enron friends
some of you may know that i have been recently diagnosed with non - small cell
lung cancer . this wednesday may 23 i will have this cancerous tumor removed .
hopefully that will be it and all will return to normal shortly and you will see
me again soon . it is my understanding that i will be in the hospital for about
1 week and they say i will be down for another six ( 6 ) weeks after that .
apparently they have not dealt with anyone that has the same tenacity and
inability to sit still as me . at any rate i ' ll be out for a while .
during my absense my assistant , karla hesketh , will continue to do the same
wonderful job that she has done for all of us throughout the years . i have a
very good friend , john vollen who is a rep for abb out in the great northwest
that has graciously volunteered to come to houston for 2 - 3 days a week for as
long as necessary to help us with the enron business . randy hayes will also
help john and will provide introductions when necessary and appropriate . please
welcome john as you have me in the past . you will find that he is eager to help
and very capable . he has been in sales for ten years and is a graduate
engineer . just don ' t get to used to him as i will return .
after i get home i ' ll call to check on all of you and make sure that all is well
with business and you personally . i am very grateful to have the enron account
and i have grown close to many of you and enjoy working on the interesting , and
yes , sometimes challenging projects that we are faced with .
again , please continue to work with john and karla as you have worked with me in
the past . i ' ll keep you updated as to my progress .
best regards ,
mike
