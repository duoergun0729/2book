Subject: structure for storage loans / deferred payment deals
the memo attached summarizes a structured deal that the market has shown some interest .
essentially , this deal allows an ldc to defer payment for gas and avoid carrying costs ( which may result in a dollar for dollar benefit to your customer ' s bottom line ) .
we have done two of these deals to date . ena has interest in additional deals ( albeit not an infinite appetite ) if the structure allows us to move them off the balance sheet .
please review the memo and target any of your customers that may have an interest .
each deal will require a new quote from credit and from the cost of funds group . gas structuring is set up to structure these deals and develop them through to execution .
