Subject: re : plan b
in addition i think that jennifer shipos ( originally slated for tx marketing ) will be better suited to return to the derivatives group . that being the case , tom , barry , brian and i agree that we should extend an offer to morris larubbio . if gary and morris accept , that will complete the 2 marketing slots for texas .
