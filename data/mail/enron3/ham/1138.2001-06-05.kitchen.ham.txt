batten down the hatch ' s and get ready for young scott ' s first experience with tropical storms ! here comes allison !
on another note we went live with tq yesterday . unbelievable huh . . . we did one trade with tuscon elec . the first day and today we did three , all with pg & e , who happen to own 40 % of tq . pretty lame .
on a good note , we hit a record today with brokerclient , 53 trades . 46 power and 7 gas , which is nicely diversifying .
other interesting note : we launched reuters on monday and the nymex wants to put it up on one of their huge wallboards . they would buy a block of desktops to cover it . bad news is that , john arnold , my new boss in approx 25 days , with some justification thinks this is a bad idea . he will lose the ability to arb the floor against the otc . my view is that this will go away anyway as enymex and icex do the same thing . what are your thoughts ?
hope all is well
