Subject: quick update
louise ,
at the moment . . . . . . . beth perlman , zhiyong wei and dave nommensen are out of the office for a few days , so it ' s a little difficult to work through the resource issues . however , i ' ve got some dialog going with some of the other technical resources ( like francis lim , and sanjay gupta ) at the moment .
as the tagg / erms team has a large task list ( prioritised by the business on a bi - weekly basis ) , i ' ve asked them to produce a list of all north america tasks , paying particular attention to those that may have been poorly prioritised . i ' m doing this so we can identify which resources are working towards the gtv .
i ' d still like the opportunity of getting a global valuation presentation to you before we dismember the team though , and would appreciate 1 / 2 hour of your time if you can spare it , over the next couple of days . would this be possible ?
regards
steve
