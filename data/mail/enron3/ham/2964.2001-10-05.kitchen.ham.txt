thanks againg for sharing your thoughts and opinions in our 10 / 3 meeting . in an effort to make our 10 / 8 meeting as productive as possible , i have put together an agenda ( attached ) for the monday afternoon meeting . it would be most helpful if you could review the agenda prior to the meeting and come ready to discuss your thoughts related to the discussion items . if the discussion items do not address your primary issues , please let me know so i can either modify the agenda or include it in the next meeting . if you have any questions , plese ask .
