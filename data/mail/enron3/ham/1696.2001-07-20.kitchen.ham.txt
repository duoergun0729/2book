Subject: longview bids - confidential
louise ,
this is incomplete with some bids expected next week . a lot of companies had a late start due to the 4 th of july holiday so they have been whining this week about an extension . bids are preliminary and based solely on the info memo . bids are in addition to all sunk costs :
mccook metals - $ 20 mm ( this is an ongoing , slow negotiation )
ppl global - $ 15 mm
reliant $ 10 mm
indicated that they will submit bid later today / over weekend / early next week :
calpine
allegheny
aes
sempra
williams
el paso
nrg
dynegy
i expect some of these wont show up .
out for various reasons :
mirant
constellation
entergy
fpl
pg & e
orion
pseg
tractabel
if we end up with 5 - 6 positive bids , even if they are non - binding , i think it supports risking additional capital to get this project fully developed / sold ( dash in process ) .
one interesting note : allegheny wants to see our offer . if we have several reasonable bids ( $ 10 - $ 20 ) , it might make sense to offer a high outlier .
i will update .
regards ,
