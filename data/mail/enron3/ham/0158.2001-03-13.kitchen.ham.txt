hi kim -
dennis vegas and i would like to set up a brief 15 minute meeting with john . experienceenron has already been supporting his commercial team , however , we would like to increase john ' s awareness about the repertoire of services in our group that can potentially help his team achieve their revenue goals . by talking to john , it will also help us understand what opportunities exist in his organization and where we can add value .
dennis and i have been meeting with the wholesale services business unit leaders and would like a few minutes to meet john . if possible we would like to combine a meeting with john and louise , but let us know what john prefers .
thank you .
carrie
