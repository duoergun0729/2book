Subject: estimated costs in cgs physical sow
louise ,
i got your note regarding the estimated costs in cgs physical statement of work . according to my knowledge , the indirect expense includes overheads of hr , corp , accounting , tax , legal , infrastructure , etc . the estimated indirect expense of the project for ea is $ 281 , 415 . there are direct expenses associated with steve stock ' s and beth perlman ' s cost centers . the estimated direct expense of the project for ea is $ 184 , 107 . the estimated cost center & indirect expense for ea is the sum of those two types of expenses and is equal to $ 465 , 522 that is presented in the document .
therefore , i am afraid that my estimated project costs presented in the document do include all corporate and cost center overheads . would you please let me know if i missed anything else ?
thanks
