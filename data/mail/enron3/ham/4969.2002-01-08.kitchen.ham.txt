Subject: direct connections
louise ,
about 1 month ago , the process was initiated to disconnect the direct connections .
experience showed that we were spending money on something which provided little benefit to the customer .
there is a chance that this process was not completed for every company ( i am checking ) .
i intend to ensure that the direct connections are all converted to regular internet connections .
if you want the direct connections maintained , please let me know .
