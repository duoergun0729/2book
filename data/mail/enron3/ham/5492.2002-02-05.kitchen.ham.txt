i just wanted to say thanks to all of you for your hard work in getting the documentation to the stage it is at today . i know things have been very difficult but this is a huge step in moving us forward . unfortunately i do not see things getting much easier during our start - up months but i really do believe it will all be worth it and hopefully we ' ll have a lot of fun along the way .
the commercial team was extremely pleased to receive the documentation and has set off to deliver them to our new customers .
thanks for your late and long hours .
louise
