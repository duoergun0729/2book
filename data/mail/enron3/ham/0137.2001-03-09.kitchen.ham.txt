Subject: pastoria dash
attached is a revised presentation for the upcoming meeting . i understand rebecca has reviewed a previous draft but i have not received any comments from her .
the dash is currently being presented to jordan mintz and ben glisan for signature by lisa bills of global finance . i will send it to you asap .
one thing requires clarifcation . the dash to be presented to the board will seek approvals related to development expenses , a turbine purchase and gas transportation . it will not seek approval of the sale of pastoria to calpine . per rac , the sale does not require board approval and is being processed under a separate dash .
the resolutions will be sent to you in about one hour . our counsel , karen jones , is on the west coast and will be in the office shortly .
call me at x 5 / 8992 should you have any questions . thanks .
