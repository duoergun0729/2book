earliest is first week in december , but overall deal is at risk - they are having consent issues due to qf status . basically , this acquisition puts nrg ' s interest up to 65 % ; nsp owns 64 % of nrg but has 90 % of the voting shares . if you count the 64 % ownership , nsp is below 50 % and ok . if you consider the 90 % then nsp is over 50 % and the qf is bust .
our counsel ( labeuf ) didnot see a problem with this , but apparently they are the only firm that will give a good opinion . the bank ' s counsel has set up an informal ferc meeting . if the ferc staffers nod approval - we can get it done . if not , we have a probem . our original solution to this potantial problem was to sell them the loan , but this looks a little difficult for nrg to swallow in light of our now infamous innovative financing structures .
