subject : meritocracy re : management sub - committee
importance : high
based on today ' s meeting , please complete the following :
look at the bullet points related to prtm ' s definition of a meritocracy and redefine those points to represent enron ' s meritocratic culture .
as recommended by louise , substitute the word " client " to enron .
mail to me a . s . a . p . your distinctive bullets .
i will lump everyone ' s bullet points together and we can choose from the best .
in addition , i will touch base with robert jones to make sure that we are targeting at least a 100 candidates with a variety of backgrounds that we can relate back to each meritocracy bullet point .
any questions , please email or call me x 31931 .
regards , mrha
