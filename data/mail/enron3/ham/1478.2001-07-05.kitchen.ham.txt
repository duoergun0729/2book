louise ,
as of today , i intend to be at monday ' s prc ( sue is doing fine ) and catch an 8 : 30 pm flight back . i am preparing a prc report for you and tim in the event i do not make it . the report will be easier to deal with than the pep reports and will reflect my summary evaluation of analysts , associates , managers , directors , and vps in my group .
