Subject: off - site travel question
the e - mail that was sent out many weeks ago about the off - site indicated that it would run from wednesday night to saturday am . it is now running thursday until sunday . calger has found a leased plane that costs roughly $ 13 k for one roundtrip and a total of $ 20 k for two round trips . i had already made arraingements to attend a wedding in oregon on saturday night . it is a good friend of mine and my wife ' s . it ' s in eastern oregon and is about a four hour drive away . i see the following choices before me :
1 . don ' t go to colorado . tell you guys that i ' m a family man and not a company man .
2 . go to colorado and fly home commercial on friday night , leaving at about 4 pm . incremental cost of flight would be $ 500 .
3 . go to colorado and fly home on the rented plane on early saturday afternoon . incremental cost of flight would be $ 7 , 000 .
4 . don ' t go to wedding . tell my wife that i ' m a company man and that it is critical that i ride mountain bikes with a bunch of 30 - something enron folks all weekend .
while i have authority to place millions of dollars of the company ' s money at risk , i don ' t feel comfortable signing up for a $ 7 , 000 extra flight without talking to you guys . # 3 , the jet set answer costs quite a bit more , but it dramatically increases the amount of time that i spend in colorado . # 2 is cost - effective but gives me less than 24 hours in colorado . # 4 , while perhaps appealing to you , doesn ' t work for me . # 2 is probably preferable to # 1 , just requires a lot of travel time to me .
any thoughts would be greatly appreciated .
