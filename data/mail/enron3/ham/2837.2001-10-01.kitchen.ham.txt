we are at 196 . 5 bcfs , and origination of $ 4 . 3 million . we don ' t have " mini - books " to calculate our mark to market , but we ' ll have it ready this morning for you .
by the way , we closed a financial zinc deal , with galvak ( alfa group ) , in which we made around $ 75 k . the customer bought a fixed price and a tunnel , for a total of 45 , 600 tons . we negotiated it with enron metals ( london group ) , and it was back - to - backed with ena .
best regards .
