Subject: southwest power financing
louise ,
i spoke to chip and he mentioned your concern / question about the financing of this project . to be clear , the turbines and some of the equipment are in turbopark . however , global finance does not want to construct this project inside of turbopark because accounting believes that would be problematic for our fair market value treatment of our merchant investments . global finance ' s plan is to provide a jedi ii / ena bridge loan to the project for the non - turbine construction costs through a bridge loan from may 1 through sep 30 . the expected loan amount during this time period is $ 30 mm , split between ena and jedi ii . our economics assume the bridge loan is priced at 15 % . global finance has committed to arrange non - recourse project financing so that ena / jedi will have only a $ 40 mm combined investment once the financing closes by sep 30 . also during this time period we will be actively marketing the project with the intent to divest of it fully prior to sep 30 .
hopefully that clarifies things .
regards ,
