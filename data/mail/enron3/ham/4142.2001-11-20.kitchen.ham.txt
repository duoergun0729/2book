here is the org chart that captures our discussions . i think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ena and ees .
total headcount = 21 . the personnel cost = $ 6 . 4 mm ( total for ena and ees ) .
please let me know if you have any questions .
