Subject: lv cogen non - recourse debt
i was incorrect . the existing non - recourse debt for las vegas ( $ 55 mm ) is off - balance sheet and off - credit . it does not show up as a liability on our balance sheet and it is not part of our footnotes . if the plant blew up , we would be out $ 24 mm , not $ 79 mm . we get this treatment because it is a fair market value asset and we have a friend of enron minority investor that keeps our stated interest below 50 % . our interest for control purposes is over 50 % because we have a call option on the friend of enron shares .
