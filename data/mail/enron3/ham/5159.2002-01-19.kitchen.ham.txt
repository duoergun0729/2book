louise and david ,
couple of comments on the contract :
- if i am terminated w / o cause , either the non - compete / non - solicit provision shall not apply or i should be paid a severance . as i see it , the bonus payments and incentive awards are current incentive to be part of ubs and can not be considered severance in the event of termination w / o cause . my preference is to be released from the non - compete / non - solicit provisions . if ubs prefers severance , it should be a total payout of the contract : the existing payments and equity , base salary and anticipated bonus ( 1 % of pro - forma bonus pool ) .
- doesn ' t enron need to sign this as well or at least have a side letter that addresses the references to enron ?
- two people have asked about accelerating the payout date so that the first payment is at closing , the second is 6 months from now and the equity vests at 12 months and then 18 months . i would like to tell them that no one is getting that - true ?
regards ,
chris
