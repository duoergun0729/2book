given my dealings with mhi in the past , i think this would be difficult to get at a reasonable level . that being said , at some level they would agree , but i don ' t have a good idea of the level . however , at this point , i don ' t think we should go in this direction . i think we should continue to play out the options that we are pursuing and see if they are successful . give us a few weeks and then re - assess .

subject : thoughts post turbine meeting
is there any possibility of negotiating a way out of the mitsubishi contracts by paying them a fee . i know we have no cancellation charge but can we just say we will pay them $ 10 mm to cancel the contracts ? if we could do we want to do this ?
how much money would we lose ( how much of a write down would we take ) if i told you i wanted to get rid of the turbines by the end of september ?
as an aside , the mitsubishis will be leaving the enron americas balance sheet now and moving to egas . this does not and should not however change anything in terms of how we are moving forward . for the company overall , we need to move these turbines ( as with all the others ) as soon as possible and we ( in the americas ) are in a much better position than egas is to move them . i have spoken to jim on this issue who is obviously in agreement with the way forward .
