given the volatility in the gas market ( which is the sole impact on the canadian power book ' s us dollar exposure ) and the exhorbitant cost involved in hedging multi - year cashflows ( i . e . as evidenced by friday 10 / 19 / 2001 trade of - $ 1 , 200 , 000 cdn new deal value for the 14 year swap that i entered into ) , i will manage the currency exposure of this book myself , i will hedge appropriately when i see fit and will not accept hedges forced on enron canada because of arbitrary position limits set by your department .
