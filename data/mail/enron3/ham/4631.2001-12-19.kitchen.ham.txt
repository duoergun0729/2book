Subject: auction documents
louise ,
sorry to bother you with this request , but i ' m not sure who else to ask :
a number of people have expressed an interest in the details of the auction process and any insight it might provide as to what a final deal might look like .
are there publically available documents covering the auctions process and descriptions of compliant bids ?
