steve ' s resigned , going back to boston where his wife has a job . i said i ' d see whether na can use him or ees , ( he ' s not keen to leave the company ) . i also asked him to talk to chris mckey re metals in new york . ( chris , perhaps you could give him a call if he doesn ' t ) .
he is likely to end up at calpine , intergen or dynegy if we can ' t place him .
