we have a verbal okay from el paso to go to the insurance wrappers and get structure / pricing . the insitituions will then pitch this back to us both ( el paso and enron ) for a decision . once the decision is made , the process should be fairly swift .
as a back up plan , joe asked the institutions to have the insurers look at a wrap without fixing the confidentiality / guarantee and using an enron to fill any potential holes . we ' ll then be able to balance timing vs proceeds vs legal risk .
