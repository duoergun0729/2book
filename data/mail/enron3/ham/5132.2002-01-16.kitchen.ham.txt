subject : content contracts
anne ,
i received your voice mail . we are working with each vendor to assign the contracts or enter into new contracts as required in order to ensure that content is available on relaunch of the system .
affected contracts are :
intelligence press - no agreement required .
accuweather - have verbally agreed to continue service to the new entity
dow jones - have verbally agreed to continue service to the new entity
reuters - working on new month - to - month contract with them .
we will work with leslie on getting written consents .
thanks ,
dave
