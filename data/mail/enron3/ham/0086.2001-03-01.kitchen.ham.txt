Subject: re : upstream and bridgeline 2001 plan presentation
thank you for sending the revised plans . i tried to make changes to the bridgeline income statement , but could not alter the inputs . as such , please make the following revisions for the 2001 plan column :
originations - 891
accrual income , bridgeline equity earnings 9 , 600
other - lrc / napooleonville 1 , 146
total margin 11 , 637
capital charge 25 , 127
total margin net of capital charge - 13 , 490
the capital charge has increased by an approved work order ( no . co 07579 ) of $ 2 , 749 , 865 to complete construction of napoleonville well no . 1 . this work was approved in 1996 as part of the original scope of the project and helps to satisfy and finalize ena ' s storage capital contribution for bhlp . however , no funding had been allocated to this work order .
there will not be any more capital obligations on enron ' s behalf for bridgeline .
since this work order applies to pp & e , i have charged 8 . 5 % against the $ 2 . 75 million - - resulting in a capital charge of $ 234 thousand . as such , to remain true to approved plan numbers , i have increased originations .
i will not be in the office tomorrow , but i can be reached by cell ( 713 - 302 - 4187 ) . in addition , brian redmond should be able to field any questions .
regards ,
jean
