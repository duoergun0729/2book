Subject: fw : enw assets to transfer back to ea
it looks like most of these assets relate to systems that sally beck ' s group uses . these assets were moved off the ena balance sheet earlier this year after discussions with you and philippe . please advise if you want us to agree to these transfers . thanks !

elaine ,
attached is a listing of the assets on enw ' s books that they want to transfer back to ea . the current book value as of 7 / 31 / 2001 is around $ 9 million dollars that would move into pp & e .
if you look at the numbers off to the right and the notes below , you will see that some of them were originally designated as shared assets or solely enw and therefore would reside on enw ' s books .
in completing their 2002 plan and meeting with their commercial people , enw thinks these assets should be back on ea ' s books .
please let me know if you agree to this .
thanks ,
stacey
