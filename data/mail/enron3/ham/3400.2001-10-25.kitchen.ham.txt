Subject: today ' s meeting
went very well . lots of positive vibes afterwards and goodwill towards both of you . people most appreciated executives admitting to the fact that things were wrong and they were frustrated too , but everyone needs to get over it . big change from past history of blaming everyone but ourselves and just glossing over the real problems and making them sound better . . . .
