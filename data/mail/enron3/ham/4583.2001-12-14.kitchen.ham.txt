subject : re : revised draft of the assignment and license agreement
a couple of comments on the revised form of assignment and license
1 . this appears to allow the estate to use the software ( including the enrononline software ) and the processes and services covered by the patents for trading gas and power within north america . is this the new deal ? for the template and the wind deal ? also , does 3 . 1 ( b ) allow enron to sell the processes covered by the patents without any restriction on field of use ?
2 . are we now going to give enron the right to sublicense and distribute source code ? i thought we were going to limit it to object code .
3 . in section 3 . 1 do we need to define affiliates ?
4 . are the restrictions on asssignment and licensing in section 4 . 4 supposed cover all the software , including the mid and back office functions , or only the eol software ?

here is the revised draft reflecting comments from enron management team
and enron legal team ( houston ) .
for some reason , i am unable to run comparite remotely . if someone located
in nyo could run a comparison between version 3 and version 6 and
distribute to this same list it will aid people in the review . thanks .
