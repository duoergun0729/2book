louise :
it is my understanding that , notwithstanding the new vs . used election entered into ibuyit , it deploys used prior to ordering new equipment . it is also my understanding that this is especially the case for flat panels in light of the decision to outfit enron center south with new displays .

just so you know , i am nearer the bottom of the issue .
a user of ibuyit can select whether they want new equipment or old equipment . so i surveyed our assistants - obviously more than ours up here , to see if any of them knew that you could order old equipment instead of new . none of them did , including tj black who has since i have been receiving my weekly reports ordered the most it equipment .
jenny ' s group is to some extent relying upon this selection to buy the equipment . don black ' s equipment was bought new even though he is about to move but will get used in remote offices where they have no flat panels . so the buying is done by ea and someone else is benefitting .
as there is no way around ibuyit , i think we need a default where we use old equipment instead of new equipment .
as no - one replied to my previous email - i live in hope .
thanks

here ' s a little issue .
we have recently needed some screens , pcs etc for new starters . obviously this is a bit of a peculiar time to buy something when we are on the point of moving . my understanding from don black ( who is hiring these people ) is that we have to use ibuyit to request equipment for these people rather than just get it to give us a temporary ( old screens from egm ) until we move . what is happening behind the scenes on this issue - do you go an buy new ones or is someone substituting ones that are now redundent ?
thanks
