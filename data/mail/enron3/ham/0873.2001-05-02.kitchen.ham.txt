jean ,
i talked with mike last night and i think that it would be beneficial if you sat down and talked with him about his expectations and try and get him an answer on his situation by the end of this week . he will be in this afternoon and will be available to talk with you . he has re - confirmed his faith you in that you will be able to go to bat appropriately for him and has avoided pushing it very much until now . he is looking for an answer by the end of this week if at all possible . i know that we cannot tie his compensation to future business that he may bring in through deals with aep . however , i strongly believe that taking care of him properly at this point in time will bear significant fruit for our p & l through 2001 . this may or may not be my place to transmit this to you , but i felt it was appropriate as i believe it will have a real impact to our business . i have developed a strong commercial relationship with mike and plan on continuing it after he leaves enron as he will be a good source for getting my group into deals . mike has been a strong commercial resource for enron over time , particularly in light of the fact that he has put his future role at aep on hold to get this deal done . he clearly has been an unselfish , integral commercial resource create significant value for enron on a very difficult , complex deal .
nonetheless , i would talk to him this afternoon and try to get him taken care of this week to close the loop appropriately . i am preparing a closing celebration plan for your review later today .
thanks ,
chris
