Subject: fw : originations schedule
faith ,
per our discussion , enovate and central are the same . enovate / chicago and central desk / houston should be included in my teams numbers and are reflective of my goals / objectives for the year 2001 . one number should be viewed as central / origination .
thanx ,
laura

it might be quicker to just take the number from the dpr and split it out into a number by originator , as we do need the information for monday ' s prc . the numbers below are the total per region which need dividing up by originator .
frank $ 8 , 261 , 000
enovate $ 6 , 219 , 000
laura $ 2 , 357 , 000
fred $ 19 , 465 , 000
please send back the divided numbers to both faith and i .
thanks

hi louise ,
as requested , attached is a file that contains june ytd originations by originator .
we ' ve arranged the file in the following sorts :
? by team
? by originator ( sorted alphabetically )
? by originator ( sorted by value )
? top 10 overall originators by value
? top 10 originators - gas
? top 10 originators - power
an item to note is that not all deals had a related individual ' s name ( such as enduser ) - we left the listing as it appears in the risk book in these cases .
we ' ll send you an update if the dpr amounts move ( the dpr isn ' t final yet . )
please let me know if you need any additional information !
