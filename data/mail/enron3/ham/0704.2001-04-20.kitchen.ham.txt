Subject: immigration update
louise and marcus ,
we ' re still in the waiting period with the green card process .
i confirmed that louise can elect to participate in the domestic health plan . this will allow participation in the prescription drug program and a network option with co - payments , rather than turning in all receipts for reimbursement . as we discussed , you do not want any changes until after the baby is born . let me know when you would like to get together to discuss the advantages / disadvantages of switching to the domestic plan .
pwc sent over a draft of their deferred compensation scheme today . i have forwarded to the compensation team for review and comment .
try to send over a copy of louise ' s new social security card this week . also , we would like to follow up on your unreimbursed medical claims .
regards ,
