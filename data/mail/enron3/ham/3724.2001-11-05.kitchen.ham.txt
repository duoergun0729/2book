pursuant to jeff hodge ' s email below , effective tuesday , november 6 , for all counterparties with both a master firm contract and a gisb , all firm deals ( eol and telephonic ) , regardless of length ( including one day deals ) should be attached to the master firm contract . with respect to eol deals , profile manager has been updated to accommodate this change . for counterparties with only a gisb as a master , you may continue attaching firm deals up to one month in duration .

subject : master firm agreements
stacey and ellen :
in light of current circumstances , if a counterparty has both a master firm and a gisb , please confirm all firm physical transactions ( both telephonic and eol ) under the master firm and not the gisb .
additionally , could one of you provide me a list of eol counterparties who have a gisb contract listed as their master agreement for eol .
thanks ,
jeff
