increasing political and market pressures to erase the us / mexico energy border
the policy focus in the administrations of both vicente fox in mexico and
george w . bush in the united states , combined with the high - profile energy
crisis in california and record - level gas prices , has pushed energy trade and
interconnections to the forefront of the political agenda . cross - border energy
flows will likely be a prominent theme between the two countries in the months
ahead . however , critical technical , regulatory , and financing constraints must
be overcome before these energy flows reach the potential indicated by current
market fundamentals .
key issues affecting us - mexico cross - border energy flows include
* asymmetrical regulatory and market structures
* power grid synchronization issues
* high investment needs in a changing regulatory environment
* uncertainty of long - term regional supply - demand imbalances
* * end * *
