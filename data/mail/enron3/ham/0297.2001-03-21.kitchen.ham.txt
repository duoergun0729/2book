good morning ,
here are the recent developments in the california power crisis :
- yesterday , governor davis gave a press conference to announce a qf agreement that would ensure future utility payments and possibly deter involuntary bankruptcy filings by certain qfs . a cpuc order on long - term qf contracts is expected next tuesday .
- corroborating the governor ' s announcement , edison international and pg & e corp each announced yesterday that it reached agreement with the qfs for payment of future deliveries .
- the governor laid out a schedule that targets a final resolution to the utilities ' final crisis by mid - april . on april 3 , the cpuc is expected to issue an order on dwr cost recovery . a final settlement for the utilities is anticipated 10 - 15 days afterwards .
- significantly , the governor expects that ( 1 ) the final settlement will occur within the existing rate structure , and ( 2 ) that the dwr will recover its costs with priority over the qfs and utilities .
- the achievement of a qf agreement may make potential bankruptcy appear more remote and therefore support the stocks in the near - term . however , we believe that substantially more effort will be required to resolve the utilities ' financial crisis . we recommend that investors avoid eix ( $ 12 . 04 , hold ) and pcg ( $ 11 . 40 , hold ) , unless they have a high tolerance for risk and volatility .
please call us with any questions you may have .
