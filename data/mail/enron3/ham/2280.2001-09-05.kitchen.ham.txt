sorry louise !
actually she is a temp , i am currently evaluating whether we are going to keep her longer term , ( clearly one of the issues is whether i can afford for all our secrets to come winging their way over to you ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! )
just joking . hope you come over and visit us soon .

the general consensus is that it would be best to run the offsite on a saturday . so far however , there does not seem to be any saturdays in september that everyone is available . we are therefore going to try and aim for sat 6 th october . could you please let me know as soon as possible whether will be able to make this date .
any questions , please call me ( x 35419 )
thx

as mentioned in joe ' s note , we are currently setting up departmental offsites . this will be an opportunity for you all to get together and discuss how your group plan to achieve its goals and vision . ideally this will be held on a week day , however , market and business demands may mean running it on a saturday .
if possible , please let me know your availability over the next few weeks . louise kitchenham will also be contacting you to follow this up .
if you have any questions , please feel free to contact me .
thanks
