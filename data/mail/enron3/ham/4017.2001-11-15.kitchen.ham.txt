just to confirm
payment through wed - 11 / 14 ( with interest ) = $ 14 , 153 , 688 . 78
payment through thur - 11 / 15 ( with interest ) = $ 14 , 155 , 586 . 71
the settlement agreement is written based on a wed payment - if they want to argue for another $ 1 , 100 in interest , then we can send it to them in pennies .
