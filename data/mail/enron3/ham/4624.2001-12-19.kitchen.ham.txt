louise ,
since our conversation today , i have discovered that by terminating the reuters contract , we will lose the entire headline news category , as well as the stock quotes , sports news and weather news .
reuters costs over $ 80 , 000 per month . this pushes the cost of content for newco to over $ 360 , 000 for relatively little benefit .
therefore , contrary to what we agreed earlier , i would like to drop all of the content on the right side of the quotes screen . we will adjust screen size or insert graphics accordingly to get things looking right until our phase 3 expansion .
please advise if you agree .
