Subject: abb turbines - status re resolving the transfer issues
louise ,
we received your note of july 2 . rather than forcing you into the role of arbitrator at the outset , we decided to try to resolve the turbine transfer issues with chris calger first . accordingly we had forwarded a proposal to chris on friday , and together with chris we worked out a revised proposal yesterday , incorporating some of the concepts in your note . chris will be reviewing the revised proposal with ben tomorrow to get his input , and chris planned to touch base with you afterwards .
