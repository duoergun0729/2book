Subject: ena a & a
john / louise
as of now i will also be working on the general a & a pool for ena as well as working with you on the trading and orig . tracks . i just got the numbers from the a & a program on the ena participation on the forthcoming a & a fantastic friday / super saturday interview dates . as you can see ena ' s participation is very low ( pretty dismal ) . the de - brief sessions basically allows interviewers to select the candidates to their groups there and then . . . so ena has to be there .
oct 26 has only 5 ena interviewers all the remaining interviewers are ees and eim . i know ees are stacking quite heavy on the a & a side . therefore , i will shortly be e : mailing your direct reports to solicit their and their direct report ' s participation in these interviews . it would be helpful if this could be re - inforced by you .
many thanks ! .
