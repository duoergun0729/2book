doug ,
i believe that we should also extend the time period for the reference of disputed items on the working capital statement since we may not resolve everything by the 4 th of december ( given the holidays ) , which by my calculations would be the date for referral of disputed working capital items to the independent auditors . perhaps we could go ahead and build in an extension period for the working capital items that would coincide with the extension for the inventory . let me know what you think . thanks , anne
