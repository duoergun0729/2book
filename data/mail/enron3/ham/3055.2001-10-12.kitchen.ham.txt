subject : duke meeting - pluto line
importance : high
i met with stephen noe over lunch yesterday to discuss the sale of the pluto gathering line . as per our internal meeting on wednesday , i questioned stephen about duke ' s evaluation based upon the data provided thus far . enron has provided duke with the gathering agreement which contains the guaranteed revenue stream . i informed stephen that enron would like to know a notional type value for the pluto gathering line . we both recognized that the value would be highly dependent upon the discount factor being applied to the revenue stream .
stephen informed me that duke ' s evaluation to date showed a value in the $ 14 to 15 mm range . stephen stated that management had not reviewed that evaluation . however , based upon the notional value duke has derived , it appears that duke is using a discount factor very similar to the factor enron is using . i stated that there should be some reserve upside and future option value .
based upon this discussion with duke , i would recommend that we proceed with setting up a mariner meeting to review geophysical data and begin trying to get marathon approval for release of the production handing agreement ( pha ) . i will contact richard clark regarding the pha .
if you have any questions please give me a call at ext . 33541 .
thanks . . . kevin
