Subject: california update 5 / 14 / 01
? over the weekend , gov . davis and senate polance made an informal agreement whereby senate polance has agreed to sponsor the socal mou bill . polanco is a democrat and is currently suffering through a personal scandal and as a result , it is reported that his political career is essential dead . polance is planning to run for mayor of los angeles rather than run for another senate term .
? the bill is expected to be introduced in the new extraordinary session , beginning today or tomorrow . the bill would first go to the senate energy committee . sen . bowen , the chair of the committee , strongly opposes the mou , so the bill is expected to remain in committee hearings for some time . the longer the bill is involved in committee politics and changes are made , the likelihood of a socal bankruptcy increases .
