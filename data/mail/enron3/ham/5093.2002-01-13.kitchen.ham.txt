Subject: 11 / 30 books
there seems to be some confusion around the calculation of books on 11 / 30 / 2001 . all books were run properly in the gas and power area on 11 / 30 , as that was the last day prior to the bankruptcy declaration . please let myself or sally beck know if you have any questions regarding this .
thanks
