as you probably know , rogers ( in the east ) and don ( in the west ) will be working directly with the wholesale desk . tim and i will ensure a fair balance is achieved between retail and wholesale .
as an enron shareholder , i fully appreciate that we need explosive growth and profitability out of ees , particularly with reduced volatility in gas and power markets over the next several years .
i am commited to ensuring that the retail risk management organization is offered all the tools , information , systems , competitive pricing , etc . to allow ees to offer fully bundled competitively priced products to retail customers .
i look forward to working with you and dave in continuing to grow this business .
