Subject: re : addition to weekly update
no problem . could i please have the bhlp update ready for next week ' s version ?
in addition , what was the outcome of the mariner update meeting with tim detmering ? plus , i have been thinking about the mariner board member representation from enron ( mostly ecr ) . wouldn ' t be appropriate to have tom byargeon as a board member ? production offshore does have megs / pluto and their commercial group ' s focus is on the deepwater gom .
regards , jean
