Subject: eol gas documents
we have determined ( vickers and tycholiz and hodge ) that no interruptible gas is transacted on line , but certain firm gas descriptions excuse performance on the basis of normal pipeline constraints ( without liability ) . therefore , for phase 1 rollout no eol interruptible / spot gtc is needed . in phase 3 they may consider adding some interruptible products on line . they do want an over the counter interruptible gtc , which will be prepared . in any event , all eol physical gas will be sold online in phase 1 under the firm gtc ( until masters are signed ) . the phase 1 eol decision tree will then be if gisb master signed , up to 30 day firm gas under gisb , over 30 under firm gtc . if firm master signed , all gas under firm master .
any questions , please call .
cordially ,
