happy to get together on monday to give you all detail . yes , you are right , there is no such thing as schedule c or deferred account , it is cash . the $ 1 mm cash in schedule c is due back to tbg in january 2002 anyway , even if we do not restructure the deal to our favor . the additional $ 800 k is cash contributed by office of the chair ( john l . ) in december of 2000 to settle december 99 and jan 2000 with tbg . when john gave his approval to complete this settlement . he asked that i attempt to defer lump sum payment to december 1 . i moved that out to december 7 . i will get on you calendar on monday .

louise , difficult week for all of us . i hope that you are doing alright given the circumstances .
i expect to have the fully executed documents back from tbg on monday . we will be paying them approx . $ 1 . 8 million to settle jan 1 , 01 through oct 01 and convert the agreement to a baseload transaction beginning nov 1 , 01 . in addition it eliminates a $ 14 mm liability . payment will be made from combination of schedule c and deferred account . will then book between $ 700 k and $ 1 mm . as you are aware , john reviewed this situation several weeks ago and gave the go - ahead . i will contact you monday prior to execution .
