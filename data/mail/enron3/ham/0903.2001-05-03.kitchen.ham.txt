Subject: mitsubishi turbines
louise ,
i spoke with ben and he and i are in agreement . we would be prepared to take the mitsubishis into the ea turbine portfolio at cost . because they are off - balance sheet and interest gets capitalized , we think it makes sense to take a quarterly reserve approximating the actual interest charges . in the event a turbine is " flipped " , east , west and south share in the total gain . we could establish upfront a transfer price , say cost + $ 3 mm , for transfers into a project . with everyone sharing in the pain and the gain , we should be able to make the optimal decision for ea .
if brett is concerned about losing them , neither ben nor i have anything that could definitively place these machines in the next month or two . we both have projects , leads , etc . but nothing can get inked quickly . however , it is probably in enron ' s interest to have people looking for alternative uses while brett is trying to firm up his deal . in 3 - 4 months we should have a defintive plan for these machines - if we wait 2 - 3 months for brett to continue , we may not have a definitive plan for 5 - 7 months .
regards ,
