Subject: el paso update
el paso line # 1103
? the el paso restart approval has switched from the ops to the national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) . the ntsb is currently investigating the explosion to determine a cause to the blast .
? once cause is established , the project will then shift back to the ops , when they will begin to analyze the data from tests that el paso is currently running . at this point , ops may request el paso to either rerun certain tests or perform further repairs .
? the individual at ops ( in charge of el paso ' s south mainline ) indicated that all 3 lines were being investigated and tested . ops will begin to analyze the test data one line at a time ( ex . line 1103 will be completely tested , analyzed , and cleared for use before following the same steps for lines 1100 and 1110 ) . the source indicated that as these lines are being tested / repaired the current pressure on the system will not increase but instead be maintained .
? we are currently developing sources at the ntsb for the following information :
- cause of action ( # 1103 )
- timeframe to determine cause of action
