Subject: enrononline budgeting method
as you each have heard over the past few days , enrononline is currently looking at a new methodology for charging the business units for services in 2002 . we intend to move away from an allocation mindset into one where services ( in the form of products , transactions , and development ) are charged on a usage basis , allowing the business units to scale and develop their markets in a more cost responsive way . my assistant will be contacting your offices to schedule 30 minutes with each of you on friday , oct 19 th to go over the proposed plan and discuss its impact on next year ' s budget . i am confident that this process will yield a method that accurately reflects the cost of enrononline and allows each of you to make sound financial decisions about your plans to use enrononline in 2002 .
please don ' t hesitate to call me before friday with questions , and i look forward to meeting with you .
