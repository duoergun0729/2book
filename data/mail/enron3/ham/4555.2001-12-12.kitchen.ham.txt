Subject: netco power marketing
west power is starting to prepare for marketing / contracting for netco - basically coming up with the following :
target lists :
- national dealer - duke , williams , etc .
- strong regional - pacificorp , bpa , etc .
- customer - city of santa clara
contract debate :
- wish list of modifications by customer
- copy existing agreements or come up with clean new template ?
customer message :
- what do we tell them now ?
- what do we tell them when we are up and running ?
questions : do you want me to start looking after the east ? if so , should i call duran ? presto ? if i am in houston next week i can meet with the team .
thought : the most important counterparties are the big dealer / marketers that will want to have a physical gas , physical power and isda agreement . do we want me to help coordinate any of this across other groups ? sager and i are thinking through this on power - i ' m not sure where gas is .
regards ,
