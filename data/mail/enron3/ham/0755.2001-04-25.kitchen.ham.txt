subject : aep interest payment vs . coastline lawsuite costs
louise ,
i have developed the attached proposal that i would like to propose to aep . the basis of the proposal is that :
1 . aep would take on all costs , risks , liens , etc . associated with the coastline law suite ( low case $ 1 . 8 mm , expected case $ 2 . 5 mm ) .
2 . enron would forego 1 months of interest due to aep ' s failure to get doj approval ( $ 2 . 1 mm ) .
benefits to enron :
1 . potential savings in enron expense vs . aep ' s ability to capitalize the cost .
2 . enron still retains the " doj stick " in that interest payments start on 1 june instead of 1 may .
3 . enron saves time and legal costs not having to defend against the claim .
4 . enron does not have to wrestle with aep to get access to hpl staff who are involved in the suite . ( even though aep is obligated to make resources available to help us with the claim , aep will have no incentive to do so after the sale ) .
let me know if you have any objections or questions .
brian
