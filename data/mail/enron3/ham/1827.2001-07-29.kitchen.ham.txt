Subject: aig / alamac
i plan on speaking with all the interested bidders in the morning to determine the big issues from a valuation perspective . thus far , almost every one has highlighted the recent decline in power prices ( none bidders said size was an issue ) . once i have spoken with the bidders , we need to agree on the process of getting back to aig .
let me know if you all have any thoughts .
thanks ,
don
