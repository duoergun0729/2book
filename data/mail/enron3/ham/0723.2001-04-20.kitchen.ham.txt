Subject: permitting follow - up
during our meeting on loretta ( gas play version ) , you suggested we get a consultant opinion regarding the ability to permit a coal plant in texas . i ' ve selected urs , a large , texas - familiar company . in fact , their lead air quality attorney used to work on the other side , processing air permit requests for texas .
i expect a written opinion on tuesday ; however , their verbal feedback has been very favorable .
in the interim , please let me know if you have any questions / comments regarding the proposal .
