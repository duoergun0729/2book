we executed final documentation on sale of the noram rig for $ 9 million ( $ 4 . 4 million net to enron ) . although the purchaser has until april 13 th to fund , there are no contingencies in the contract and scf partners controls the entity . the delay in funding is required since there is a 21 - day period for them to make their capital calls .
a number of things came together for us this week , which is good .
the week is now over .

today we negotiated a handshake agreement with smith properties to buy out jedi ' s position in inland for $ 2 million ( $ 1 million net to enron ) . the dash minimum was $ 1 . 25 million ( $ 612 , 500 net to enron ) , the original offer . documentation will be simple : our rep is limited to we own it and we can sell it . expect to close and fund next week .
given the inland situation and the absence of any foreseeable payment on our preferred , i view this outcome as very favorable .
brandi morris ' work on this transaction was outstanding .
