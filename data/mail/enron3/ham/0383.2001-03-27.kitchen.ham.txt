Subject: fw : draft dash of dwr
louise ,
this draft is very preliminary . we have not received any input from the market risk group or regulatory . i have passed for comments to david port and jim steffes . my initial view on risk adjusted capital for market risk is that it will be zero based on the offsetting position currently in the book . we will have more information in the morning .
we can discuss further tomorrow .
thanks ,
bill
