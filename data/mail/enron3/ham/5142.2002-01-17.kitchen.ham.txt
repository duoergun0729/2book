Subject: heather vs . erica
louise ,
i think i may have made an error in selecting heather over erica for ubs . it has become apparant that , though she has kept a lower profile , erica has made a larger contribution to the system and has a broader skillset than heather ' s .
accordingly , i would like to exchange these two for receiving an offer letter . if i am able to do this on the ubs side , do you object ?
please advise as soon as you can .
thanks ,
dave
