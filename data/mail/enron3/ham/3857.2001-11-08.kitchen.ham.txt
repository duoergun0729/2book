as discussed , key members of the enron wholesale services tax group have been approached by recruiters and competitors about opportunities outside of enron . i have received 4 calls in the past 24 hours . listed below are the key people comprising the enron wholesale services tax planning group , in addition to myself , who possess significant institutional knowledge of enron ' s tax position and whose continued employment with enron ( regardless of its altered state ) is critical . for example , morris clark and jeff blumenthal were key members of the team that , with me , designed and implemented project slapshot , the continued maintenance of which stands to provide enron with over $ 100 million of tax savings . i have not spoken with other members of the enron tax department about this matter and , rather , i have come to you to obtain proper guidance since the continued employment of the below listed employees directly affects my ability to manage the ews tax position . as you can appreciate , time is of the essence . i look forward to speaking with you .
