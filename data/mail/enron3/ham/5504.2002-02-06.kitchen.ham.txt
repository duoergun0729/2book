presentation / training . it will be a powerpoint presentation that we
need your assistance ensuring can be projected as well ensuring the
traders / business have adequate number of copies of hand out material .
attached is the presentation . hand outs that we require your
assistance in handling is :

and cell phones by end of day today
- wendy bannerman clarke to supply the day 1 policy ( even if still a
