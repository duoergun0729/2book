i am sure no one wants to provide another were strong and stable speech , but we have it on an extremely confidential basis that a memo is being drafted by their risk management group ( remember the thorn in bill ' s side and mine over the last years . . . ) that recommends a ceasing of additional business with enron and a review of their remedies under our agreements for significant changes in our financial capacities . i have no idea how far dick or tom may let this go , but it is bad form . . .
