hi edie !
i have attached two files that i received from andrew parsons for enron america ' s headcount on the contingency floor . per andrew , he discussed this project , ( which will provide traders with an alternative workspace should the need arise ) , with louise kitchen . this expense project is being carried on net works books and will be allocated out to the business units using project settlement rules in the project system module of sap . this project will cover the period september through december , 2001 and should cost approximately $ 750 k in total . i will need a cost center or account or project , etc . to charge enron america ' s share ( . 270 for power and . 402 for gas ) of the costs .
thank you for your prompt attention !
