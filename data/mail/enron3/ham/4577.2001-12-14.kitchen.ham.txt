Subject: texmex obligation
louise ,
subject to final legal confirmation , it looks like i will need to terminate the participation agreement with bpub by dec . 31 , or enron could be obligated to proceed with building the hvdc tie .
from what you know about the potential purchaser / s , is there any point in my negotiating an extension of this date , or should i simply terminate ?
please advise .
thanks ,
dave
