Subject: re : vitro
louise ,
i just talked to fernando sanchez ugarte , chairman of cfc ( federal competition commission ) , and told him of our urgency
to have our request approved in the next two weeks .
he told me he will look into it today and will try to have it resolved asap . our lawyers should do the follow up , but i am
confident we will get it done in time .
regards , jaime _ _ _ _ _
