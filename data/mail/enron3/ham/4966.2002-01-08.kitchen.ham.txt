christi nicolay and sarah novosel are the two best regulatory people . in terms of pushing the timing , political clout is going to be more important which in the past would have come from kean and lay . obviously , that will not work anymore . i have a good relationship with larcamp ( ferc head of staff ) and might be able to help with the politics . i think ferc is going to want to hear directly from the new owner . if we want speed , i recommend we use the expertise of christi and sarah combined with the overall political clout of the new owner .
you are not off base with steffes at all .

my issues with rick have never been related to competence but were based on costs of his unit .
