Subject: hello everyone .
in december we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility . louise and i would like to get everyone together offsite , probably in late june ( once louise is back from holiday ( just kidding ) ) . i think it ' s time to go have a little fun with the group driving enron ' s success .
i would like suggestions as to :
1 ) where to go .
2 ) what should be the focus of the business meetings .
3 ) should we have business meetings or should we do something else ( ie . climb a mountain ) ? i ' m not a strong bid on climbing a mountain .
4 ) and any other ideas you have .
in addition i would like to start having staff meetings about once a month . the first one will be friday may 11 th at 2 : 30 p . m . please add this to your schedule . i have invited everyone who has p / l responsibility . portland , calgary and toronto will have to be on video or phone conference .
regards
john
