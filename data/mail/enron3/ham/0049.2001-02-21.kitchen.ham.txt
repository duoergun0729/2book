Subject: charter review - final version
attached is the final version of the charter review for our meeting with skilling tomorrow . i intended to get this out sooner , but preparations for our energy tech conference tomorrow kept me fairly occupied this afternoon .
i need to go through one last time with my calculator , but do not anticipate there will be any additional revisions . i need to speak at the conference from 8 : 30 to 9 : 00 a . m . tomorrow and will come directly to the 33 rd floor thereafter . i believe we meet at 9 : 45 a . m . with skilling .
if you need to reach me this evening , my cell number is ( 713 ) 854 5232 .
regards ,
