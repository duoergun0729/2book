Subject: site status report and qbr
louise :
as a follow up to our conversation early this week , i will have a draft site status report to you on tuesday . what we ' ve done is to take the site option list previously provided to you , and add a status column and a cost basis column . i ' d like to sit down with you and dave duran to go over this , and also other information on ql to make sure my group is on track from your perspective . i could have a qbr package to you by late next week or early the following , depending on when you would like to get together .
i hope you have a good weekend .
regards ,
ben
