Subject: new albany sale
john ,
quick update on sale of na to duke . stuart got them up from $ 120 mm to $ 135 mm ( should be close book value of asset at closing ) . waiting to see if they try to knock us for issues discovered during due dili including ge / power systems lawsuit . stuart is sitting down with them tomorrow to negotiate purchase and sale agreement . at best , could be in a position to sign this up next week . i assume we need to dash this or do you want to handle some other way ?
regards ,
don
