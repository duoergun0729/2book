Subject: budget
louise ,
i understand that you will shortly receive a first draft budget submission for ena . i ' m not sure what format you ' ll receive it in , but if its the standard format , it ' ll be difficult to pick out the project level estimates .
i have access to the team / project level estimates , and would be happy to pull together a quick view that suits you .
i was going to try to guess how you would like to see it , but i thought i ' d better ask you first , . . . . it ' ll probably save me a lot of work ! : ) the thought was to give you a quick handle on whats " essential - keep the business running " stuff , and what would be great but we can struggle on without .
please remember this is supposed to be a quick heads - up , and not intended to replace any full explanation that will innevitably follow later .
some alternatives ( obviously , feel free to suggest your own )
1 .
capital
team
project 1 name description ena $
project 2 name description ena $
expense
project 1 name description ena $
project 2 name description ena $
2 .
capital
team % essential % nice to have
project 1 name description ena $ 40 % 60 %
project 2 name description ena $ 80 % 20 %
expense
project 1 name description ena $
project 2 name description ena $
please let me know what you would prefer , and i ' ll try to get you the view by the end of the day .
regards
steve
