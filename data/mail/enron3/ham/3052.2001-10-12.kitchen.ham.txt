Subject: fw : producer one update
louise ,
i think what i really wanted to convey is the following :
1 . john grass originally headed up the wellhead desk and outsourcing efforts for the producer segment . i wanted him to do that because of the logistics overlap between purchasing wellhead gas and offering outsourcing services .
2 . when the volume of the wellhead desk started to increase and based on my frustation with the lack of " contract focus " with ocean energy , andex , and other producer outsourcing deals being pursued , i asked kevin miller to manage producer outsourcing and john grass to manage only the wellhead desk .
3 . based on kevin miller ' s memo ( attached below ) , the wellhead desk reporting into hunter , i have been questioning the value of a separate outsourcing effort independent of the wellhead desk .
regards , mrha
