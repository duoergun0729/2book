louise :
my understanding from legal was that corporate development as represented by donahue and the business unit had to sign off . he brought mordaunt into the picture for his legal side . i don ' t like going outside of ea anymore than you do , but according to established policy relayed to me through legal stand still and non - solicitation language requires this type of sign off .

louise :
i have given to your admin a copy of the cogentrix ca and have bracketed the language that needs your approval . legal had originally told me that i needed detmering and donahue to sign off . detmering has told me that either you or lavorato need to sign off . per my conversation with donahue , he is o . k . because kristina mordaunt has signed off on the language .
we have a little over a week to get a preliminary , non - binding bid in , if the original schedule holds , and we have held off as long as we can signing any language along these lines , but we are now starting to be backed against the wall . this language represents the best we are going to be able to accomplish in this situation .
regards ,
