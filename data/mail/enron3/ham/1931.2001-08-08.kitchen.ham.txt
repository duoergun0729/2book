louise :
i know this is a difficult time for enron given the incident at teeside , but i wanted to let you know that principal investments actually has an investment in a company called serveron ( www . serveron . com ) which makes a product that monitors transformers for risk of failure . this product / service may be a worthwhile investment at our facilities given the unfortunate accident of today and our desire for a superior safety record .
