Subject: fw : final pa and eta
louise ,
i was doing a last pass through these documents , when i noticed that the last sentence of the 2 nd to last paragraph contains something similar to what you had removed from the eta : " ubs may give counterparty ' s name to potential product providers as a prospective counterparty " . this wording was changed in the pa in sept . so was not redlined in the changes you and i reviewed earlier .
i ' m ok with this staying in . please let me know if you want it removed .

please review the attached pa and eta . these are the final versions of the documents that we plan on using . the pa might go out to the top 50 customer as early as this afternoon . we are preparing the ubswenergy ' splash page ' and will upload this version of the eta unless otherwise advised .
the entity is officially named ubs ag , london branch ( collectively " ubs " ) and the website is ubswenergy . com . if you are not in agreement with this , please advise asap .
i encourage everyone to read both of these documents very carefully . i have looked them over several times and everything looks to be in order but your ' fresh ' review is appreciated .
thanks .
carl
