Subject: first of all , thanks for doing all the things nobody will ever know about over the last two weeks that saved our company .
second , i need to get your ok on our designs for phase 3 so we can go to production in the next few days . the increased functionality and screen changes are important , and the look and feel re - design is low cost . we need some good news for our customers anyway . the attached presentation shows what it will look like and details some of the changes .
let me know what you think and hang in there , louise .
