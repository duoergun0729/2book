please let me know if you guys are still willing to do 3 - way offsets / netting / sleeving or whatever you call it . your pjm trader wants to charge about $ 100 k for 600 mw in summer 02 with el paso .
thanks . also my assistant was checking with yours to see if any alternative to 9 am tomorrow . if not we will still take it .
