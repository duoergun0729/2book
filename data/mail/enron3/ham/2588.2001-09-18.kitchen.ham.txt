Subject: im 2 ppa
mike ,
if you get this while on vacation , i do apologize for interrupting your break . i have left you a voicemail on the same subject , but thought i would send it to you in writing as well .
following up on this morning ' s meeting with louise and joe deffner on the requested ammendments , we went through the list of issues sent by tod 9 / 17 , and kevin ' s subsequent response .
as both kevin and louise stated , the first issue , the clarification on banking , is a confirmation of the " intent of the deal " . as you remember , the project ' s ability to bank recs and energy , and to carry that bank forward , is the intent of the deal . we need your recognition that this is the case so that we can go forward with this clarification ammendment .
we hope to keep this moving in your absense and appreciate your cooperation on this point . please give me a call , or at a minimum , please share your perspective with louise on this issue so that we can keep the financing moving forward .
thank you ,
michael
