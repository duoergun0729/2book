Subject: ena gas structuring
in addition to my current role of leading ena ' s wholesale gas structuring , i have been asked to take on ena ' s retail gas structuring for ees .
i have asked mark breese to take the lead on all ees related activity effective immediately . mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing , but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals . eric moon will retain his lead role on all west region deals and will take the lead on all new east region deals . eric boyt will retain his lead role for all upstream and ecr deals , and will back up eric moon on new east region deals as needed . santiago garcia ( associate ) has chosen to stay in gas structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team . finally , several associates and analysts are being added to gas structuring to handle increased wholesale deal flow and the ees effort .
mark breese , melissa solis and i have moved to the 14 th floor and we will office at the following locations :
mark breese eb - 1457 a
ed mcmichael eb - 1456 c
melissa solis eb - 1456 d
we are moving to the 14 th floor to initially be closer to the ees business as well as free up space on the 32 nd floor . this move is temporary as all gas structuring ( wholesale and retail ) will be located together on the 6 th floor in the new building .
