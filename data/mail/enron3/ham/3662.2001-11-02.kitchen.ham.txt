Subject: master netting agreements : read
1 . send forms of agreements to counterparty as a first step to get the process moving forward . if you do not have a contact at the counterparty call the credit hotline at 31803 and ask for jay williams or another credit person who can help you get the contact name and number . credit is working diligently to get specific legal entity names to us as well .
2 . at the end of each day send a status update , including specifics of steps taken , to me and carol st . clair , cc louise kitchen , bill bradford and tanya rohauer . carol and i will summarize for louise , bill and tanya , but copy them in case they are interested in any particular party on an urgent basis . management has asked that we contact the counterparties at least each day and keep this moving to closure of each agreement as quickly as possible .
