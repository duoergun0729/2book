Subject: keyspan
focus . . .
i believe we should get back in front of keyspan next week , to address or redirect any questions / concerns keyspan may have to the " general " discussions held to date . gil has been in communication with them several times since the meeting , but i believe chuck needs some constant attention / adoration to move him our direction . i would love to pop over to ny either before or after our meeting in chicago .
thoughts or updates ?
