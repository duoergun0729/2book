Subject: bp amoco and coral
jeff
the amoco netting agreement has been finalized and will be circulated for signature tomorrow as soon as i get execution sets from their attorney . on the coral side , the eei and guaranty issues have been agreed to and documentation will be executed no later than tomorrow . my understanding from harlan murphy , a colleague of mine , is that coral is not requiring the netting agreement in order to do the ring trades .
