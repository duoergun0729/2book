dan : relative to support of california issues for " ees / oldco " , once jim and his group begin supporting netco , there will be staff remaining ( clearly , staffing will be tight , and it ' s still my hope that jim decides to stay with " oldco / newco ) in regulatory affairs ( 5 professionals including myself ) to support you and others on california as well as all other issues for " ees / oldco as well as newco . . . . thanks . . . rick

following up on our discussion . . . . . . .
thank you for taking the lead to prep and set up a meeting ( s ) to get the appropriate team ( s ) prepared to testify on january 24 , 2002 .
i realize that there will be many different activities underway in the next couple of weeks , and we all include maintaining / maximizing the value of the ca book and the cpuc activities as critically important .
thanks - dan
