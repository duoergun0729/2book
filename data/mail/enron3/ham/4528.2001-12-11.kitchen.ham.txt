i didn ' t realize that was an option !
in all seriousness , we need to put some type of structure in place to deal with oldco . i understand kyle ' s concerns , and would like to do something . unfortunately , we won ' t have details about the retention package for a few more days . in the meantime , all i can do is hope kyle will give us the benefit of the doubt and do his part while we pull the details together .

kyle kitagawa will be responsible for canada . however , it is unlikely that he will be willing to do anything unless and until he is compensated either through bonus or retention pay .
