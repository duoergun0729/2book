generating facility
these guys move fast . besides requiring a little editing , i told allegheny that we would prefer to wait till monday so that we have time to place phone calls to agencies / gov officials in nevada before it hits the wires . i dont think we need to mention enron in the release . i will copy you on a later draft .

chris :
per my voicemail , attached is the press release regarding allegheny ' s 15 - year natural gas tolling agreement with enron ' s las vegas congeneration facility . please note that enron is not mentioned in the release .
according to allegheny , this deal was closed this morning at 6 am . at this point , allegheny is not sure if they are even going to issue this release , but they would like our approval just in case they decide to move forward and release it . if they do decide to issue the release , they are aiming to do so today . therefore , please provide your comments to me asap .
thanks in advance for your help and please contact me with any questions .
