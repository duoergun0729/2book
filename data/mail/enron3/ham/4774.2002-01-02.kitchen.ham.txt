big pig :
met with them today and gave an overview of operations . all went well . the cfo asked about performance measurements regarding costs per transaction . i described the operations pricing model that i implemented several years ago . they were also interested in our ability to handle increased transaction flow , and i mentioned that through the opm we were able to track the increased operational efficiencies that we experienced with the increase in transaction flow . the cfo asked to get some information regarding opm . i have a summary report that reflects the decrease in cost per transaction plotted against the increase in transaction counts . this is not currently included in the data room . do you want to review this before i pass it along to andy zipper to provide to the cfo ?
