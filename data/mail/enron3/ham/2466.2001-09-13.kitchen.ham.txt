Subject: re : fw : end of quarter funds flow targets
sorry . a bit behind on my emails . still hustling to find $ for quarter end . i may try to call you a bit later on storage but we did not see that deal . storage doesn ' t fit any of the capital pricing scenarios we have laid out - balance sheet , prm , or off balance sheet . i think , given that it ' s a liquid asset , it should be priced more like prm activity than pure debt if it is to attract a capital charge .
