Subject: structuring
earlier today mark breese resigned to accept another position . mark had been slated to go to netco in structuring to work for berney aucoin . several weeks ago eric moon also resigned . he too was slated for netco structuring . at this point berney is the only remaining individual in netco structuring . i suggest that we identify individuals that might be considered for replacements . these individuals are likely to currently be in estateco . as estateco has not yet announced any retention program i am concerned that possible replacements may elect to leave estateco before we have a chance to discuss netco positions . i would like to work with berney and the origination team to identify appropriate replacements and move to notify them of this opportunity .
