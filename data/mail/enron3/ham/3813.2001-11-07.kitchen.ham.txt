jim ,
how the mighty bruins have fallen . too bad because i thought the national championship game was within reach . oh well .
the weather desk gas gone through a fundamental transformation and has attempted to align itself with the gas and power desks . dave kistler ( origination ) and i ( mid - markets ) are getting ourselves organized and we need your help . we would like to get a west power org chart and if possible a list of your desk ' s counterparties ( we do not want to interfere with your relationships and weather derivatives may be an additional product to sell to your customers ) . if you could help us out with this , that would be great . thanks and hopefully i will get out there soon to meet the people and provide a little more clarity to what we are doing and how we can add value to you .
