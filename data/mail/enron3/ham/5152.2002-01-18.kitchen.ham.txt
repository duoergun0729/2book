Subject: ubs contract changes - the process
just discussed this with collette and ubs hr . suggestion is we proceed as follows :
any suggested change must be agreed by one of you on the enron side ( including support )
if you agree , we will capture the proposed changes on the attached form and fax it to ubs team .
if the change is simply a reallocation of dollars , as anticipated within the pool , they will generate a new contract .
if the change is incremental to the pool , or otherwise significant , collette has arranged a time on sat , sun and mon to call hutch . if he agrees she will authorise the ubs team to produce the amended form .
i anticipate suggested changes to the document text and titles . these we will also capture on above form and fax to ubs for discussion .
