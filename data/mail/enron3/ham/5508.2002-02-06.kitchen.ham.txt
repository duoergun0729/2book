tammie -
can you kindly confirm details of where , when , # of sessions if
greater than one , for this presentation . i understand you are the
person louise had designated to help us coordinate the
presentation / training . it will be a powerpoint presentation that we
need your assistance ensuring can be projected as well ensuring the
traders / business have adequate number of copies of hand out material .
attached is the presentation . hand outs that we require your
assistance in handling is :
- presentation print out
- mercy gil to supply you with a printed list of contact names phone
and cell phones by end of day today
- wendy bannerman clarke to supply the day 1 policy ( even if still a
draft ) as well as the discipline and sanction policy by end of day

tammie - if you can get all the hand outs in 1 pack that would be
great but it is not required .
please speak with debbie brackett if you have any questions , issues ,
etc and we thank you very much in advance for your assistance .
looking forward to meeting you ,
