Subject: temporary spaces in new building
i think it would be a great idea if we could get a few extra spaces for
it support in the new building .
we would need five spots .
two for enpower ( one for risk , and one for volume mangement and confirms )
two for unify ( one for logistics and one for edi )
one for gas risk
i won ' t make requests for specific personnel ( yet ) just not the most junior
personnel .
let me know if you need anything else .
thanks
