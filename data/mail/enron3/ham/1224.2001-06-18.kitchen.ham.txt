Subject: southwest power update
we are not done . on friday when we were prepared to sign , black hills energy capital said they needed until today to get a signature from their parent , black hills corp . at noon today they said that the signature was on its way . at 4 : 00 pm we heard that they will issue a l / c instead of the corp guarantee . the l / c approach is fine , but i am concerned with this flaky behavior .
our plan is to sign the purchase and sale with black hills energy capital tonight / tomorrow morning . they would have the obligation to deliver either a gurantee or an l / c for $ 15 mm by thursday . if not , we can terminate at any time prior to close of business monday . i will update when something changes .
