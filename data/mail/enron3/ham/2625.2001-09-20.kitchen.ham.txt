Subject: california update - - 09 . 20 . 01 - - noon pdt
getting alot of inquiries .
the puc has not yet voted on suspension of da or related matters .
likely to get to those items on the agenda within the next 30 - 60 minutes .
looks as if the decision will 1 ) suspend da beginning sept . 20 th and 2 ) include contract renewal in the suspension .
in addition , it appears that the proposal would give the commission some latitude to enact retroactivity back to july 1 if deemed necessary ( this is unclear and we ' re trying to get more details on this provision ) .
three key senators have sent a a letter to the puc asking the puc to provide recommendations to the legislature on the conditions under which da should be re - instated ( since the letter is dated september 18 th - - though sent only yesterday - - it appears that the senate had an idea that the puc was going to suspend ) .
keep in mind that the decision has not been voted on yet and the provisions listed above may change .
we ' ll report back as soon as something happens .
for folks who want to listen in , the number is :
415 . 228 . 4550
code = 92105
best ,
jeff
