here ' s a little issue .
we have recently needed some screens , pcs etc for new starters . obviously this is a bit of a peculiar time to buy something when we are on the point of moving . my understanding from don black ( who is hiring these people ) is that we have to use ibuyit to request equipment for these people rather than just get it to give us a temporary ( old screens from egm ) until we move . what is happening behind the scenes on this issue - do you go an buy new ones or is someone substituting ones that are now redundent ?
thanks
louise
