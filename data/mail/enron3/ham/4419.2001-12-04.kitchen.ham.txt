louise ,
colin came in this morning , spent some time with the gas team , hr and then with me , and has decided he doesn ' t want to come back .
he intends to go back to uk in q 2 and intends to chill out untill then , do some travelling etc . . . .
we had a long conversation about this , and it was evident that his mind is pretty much made up .
he was very flattered about being asked to stay on and he wanted me to pass thanks to you for thinking of him , and is sorry to have to let you down by not accepting . . . .
regards
