louise ,
seung - taek oh will be working for me as the head of real - time markets in ercot . as a two year associate he would have been eligible for promotion to manager . he was also an ubs employee and as such was an associate director . i would like to change his title from undefined to associate director .
please let me know if you have any questions .
thanks ,
doug
