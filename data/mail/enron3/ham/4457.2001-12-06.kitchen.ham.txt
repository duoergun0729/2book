Subject: benefits for terminated employees
hi all ,
i just got off the phone with the benefits center and they are informing people that it could take up to 90 days for them to send " termination packages " out to these employees and then you can send in your forms and it will take another 30 days to get a check , specifically talking about the cash balance plan money . this all happens after they get a notice that you are terminated which they usually process on the lst . . . . come on , what is up with this ? ? ? it could very well take up to 5 months for people to get a check in their hands ? that is not right . since all of you have a lot more clout than me or any of the terminated employees , i ' m hoping that someone will take this up with human resources or whomever to get this form downloadable or something to speed up this process .
thanks .
