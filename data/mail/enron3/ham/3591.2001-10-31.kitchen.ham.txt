Subject: lisa hesse
fred called yesterday to let me know he was going to move lisa hesse in to replace judy thorn on the well - head desk .
lisa is a sr . spec currently making 48 . 5 k . she was not ranked at mid - yr but was ranked strong at yr - end . she is on reduced hours which fred believes works well for the position .
just want to confirm that you are ok with this move to be effective nov . 5 . thanks
