Subject: portland lease
i had a brief discussion with marcus buergler on tuesday regarding the portland space . i indicated to him that our desire would be to move , but that we would need the current space for a short period until other arraingements can be made . in the last two days we have done some research and think that we can get a better space for less money . on top of that , there are roughly $ 600 k worth of improvements ( separating from pge ) that need to be made here that may not be required in a new sapce .
based on my very brief discussion with marcus on tuesday , i was not aware that we wre heading down a path that would force us to stay in this building . i learned today that the estate has accepted the pge lease for this space and that we have to stay here . this is very depressing if it is true .
from a money point of view i don ' t think that it is the best decsion . more importantly , from a morale point of view this place is horrible . we have 15 , 000 square feet when we need between 5 , 000 and 10 , 000 . it is absolutely depressing here . people are very much in favor of moving .
please advise .
