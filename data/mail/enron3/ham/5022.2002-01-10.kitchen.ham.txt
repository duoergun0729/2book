Subject: meeting at 4 : 30
louise ,
i know you are appropriately focused on the netco sale , yet i had tammie place me on your calendar for 4 : 30 p . m . today . i want to discuss my withdrawal as a potential employee of netco and my desire to remain with the enron estate . consistent with my ongoing concerns regarding the chicago office , i also want to ensure those employees remain with that business to preserve value to the estate . they have done an amazing job on behalf of the joint venture and pec has voiced their desire that they are retained on pec ' s behalf , no matter the counterparty .
i wanted you to know my direction even if your schedule would not permit for our meeting today .
thank you ,
laura
