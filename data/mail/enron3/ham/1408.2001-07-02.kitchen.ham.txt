fyi . we are tripping over ourselves . i will probably not go to this meeting if this is how many we take . marc ulrich and jeff merola will do fine as long as they can get their views in .

can you confirm how many people are attending this meeting from our side . it seems to be getting a little large and i think we need to make sure we are only bringing people that can add significant value to the actual meeting .
my count is as follows :
marc ulrich - urm - he is the commercial expert on comed and rate effects on our business - mandatory
jeff merola - manager of physical delivery logistics for central region - mandatory
brad snyder - structured supply
mark bernstein - structured supply
jeff ader - structured supply
janine migden - regulatory
roy boston - regulatory
rogersherndon - ews risk
name i forgot - legal - ulrich recomended he go given the comed audience
this would be 9 . i think this is too much . what are your thoughts ?
given the agenda items of 1 ) comed ppo phase - out intentions , 2 ) physical delivery issues and 3 ) potential business transactions b / w comed and enron , i think we need to trim the list of attendees .
