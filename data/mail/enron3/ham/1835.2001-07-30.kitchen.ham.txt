untangle financial jargon
by colleen bazdarich
companies ' quarterly conferences are now open to investors . but
listening in , you might very well suspect that bigwig executives and
wall street analysts are using esoteric lingo to confuse matters . next
time you ' re feeling left out , consult investorwords . com ' s copious
directory , which houses more than 5 , 000 definitions to help you decode a
company ' s latest earnings announcement or press release .
browse through the dictionary by alphabetical list , or search for a
specific word . the coolest thing about this site : each definition is
densely hyperlinked so that , within each entry , every word that ' s listed
elsewhere in the dictionary gets a link to its own definition . if you
look up ebitda , for example , you ' ll find hyperlinks to each of the
financial terms that make up the acronym : earnings , interest , taxes ,
depreciation , and amortization .
if you find the size of the investorwords database overwhelming , check
out the glossary pages , which contain definitions for more specific
subjects , from accounting to venture capital .
