louise ,
i just spoke with faith killen and she enlightened me on exactly what you ' re looking for . it is my understanding that you ' re not necessarily looking for hotlist information but more of a weekly deal update schedule which would identify deals being worked on and the status of each . she also indicated that you were looking for this information to come directly from the commercial world and not accounting .
dave ,
gary justice prepares a weekly deal schedule which includes a column for " status / follow - up . " this schedule , if completely populated for each deal , should serve this purpose . i will pass this information on to him .
thanks , paula .
