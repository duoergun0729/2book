after several very difficult weeks , enron announced on friday that the company has reached an agreement to merge with dynegy .
i know that everyone has many questions right now regarding the future of the associate / analyst program . we are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the program . as the merger points on the enron homepage indicate ( ) , dynegy has a similar program called " pace " , and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs .
today , all of the business units within enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it ' s implications for enron . i encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings .
the announcement of the deal with dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we ' ve all dealt with over the past several weeks . as decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units , we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the program .
new opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring . the very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top , and our associates and analysts will be a key part of our future success .
i appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time .
