louise :
i have attached two " job descriptions " based on my conversations with dave , john , tom m . and you . the first focuses on power / gas origination in texas / mexico as a seperate region , the second focuses on power asset development business in north america .
i know john sees a need to focus on re - establishing our position in the texas gas maket . if we combine the ercot / mexico power origination with texas and mexico gas , then this will build on my power skills , knowledge of the texas gas market , and my non - us market experience .
dave is on board with me heading up the power development activities and probably would be more on board with me focusing on ercot as this would be less disruptive to his business .
i am open to either - we can chat tomorrow .
