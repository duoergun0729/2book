Subject: 2001 plan
louise , the $ 10 . 9 million negative in the plan as presented to you consists of :
inland $ 4 . 6 mm
masada $ 2 . 9 mm
linder $ 3 . 4 mm
total $ 10 . 9 mm
these assets had been scheduled originally to go into raptor 2 . without a raptor hedge , these represent the difference between estimated valuein a monetization and carrying value .
in addition to the above , the following items are incorporated into the $ 20 . 7 mm delta ena exposure vs . base value
noram rig $ 0 . 9 mm - - the purchaser defaulted on purchase . our expectation for value is now lower .
ecogas $ 2 . 4 mm - - we acquired this asset after the budget .
canfibre loc $ 4 . 5 mm - - this contingent liability may or may not be paid depending upon certain performance tests at the lackawanna plant
calpine $ 2 . 0 mm - - this is a drilling commitment . i always view these on a dry hole basis .
total $ 9 . 8 mm
i hope this clarifies the numbers . dick .
