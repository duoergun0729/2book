Subject: california update - - 09 . 13 . 01 - - 3 : 15 pm
dwr filed comments with the california puc today urging the commission to adopt a july 1 suspension date .
in addition , dwr takes the position that , if the commission does not enact a july 1 retroactive suspension date , the commission should require that all customers who went da after july 1 pay a proportionate share of the bonds and dwr going - forward contracts .
customers and providers will strongly oppose dwr ' s proposal at the puc .
