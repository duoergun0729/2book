subject : california update - - legislative push underway
hertzberg ( speaker of the ca assembly ) called a meeting yesterday afternoon of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the " core / noncore " proposal in california . the purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for california . here ' s a summary of the meeting . please keep confidential .
work will be done over the weekend to put the core / noncore proposal in legislative language . ( we will be in the room . )
work done by the " plan b " group in the assembly ( joe dutra and joe nation ) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend .
because no proposal is " comprehensive , " a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far ( i . e . , core / noncore , " plan b , " edison mou )
in addition , there are republican demands that hertzberg will need to address ( e . g . , end the litigation ) in order to achieve bi - partison support , which is what hertzberg ' s shooting for .
to move the legislation , the plan is to establish a " conference committee , " comprised of an equal number of democrats and republicans .
the committe would begin work on monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together , vote it out of the legislature and send it to the governor for signing by monday , july 16 th .
july 16 th is the deadline because that is the date that the puc will issue its proposed decision regarding , among other things , how dwr ' s revenue requirement will be put into rates , whether direct access needs to be suspended , etc .
the puc is issuing the draft on the 16 th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the commission votes on a final order on august 15 th . ( the puc will actually issue a " thought piece " on monday the 9 th and will use reactions to the " thought piece " to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16 th . )
all of this is still up in the air , however . as of right now , the leader of the senate ( burton ) has not agreed to hertzberg ' s gameplan and the republicans , while interested , have not yet committed to join the process .
