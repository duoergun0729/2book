after consulting with the personnel of the remote team , we have assessed their needs , and are prepared to begin the initial swap - out of crts for flat panels to the various locations .
our first targets are toronto ( 10 18 " flats ) and calgary ( 25 15 " flats ) .
as we receive more through additional moves , we will include portland , new york , chicago , and other locations as needed .
i just need to know that everyone ' s okay for us to begin this process . thanks .
regards ,
