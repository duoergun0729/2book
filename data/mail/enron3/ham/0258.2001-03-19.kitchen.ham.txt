subject : ees / ena customer split
tim :
as we discussed , speaking on behalf of trading ( not origination ) our preferred approach to dividing the western region customer base into ees and ena categories would be to " let the market decide . " under this approach , ees would be free to contact any customer they wanted as we would . the customers will elect if they want to do a transaction with ees or ena . .
that said , this approach is not meant to be an antagonistic one . we would be focusing on larger accounts ( generators and load ) in excess of 1 mw who want to pre - schedule . we will not be offering a burner - tip solution that includes our having load risk or paying transmission and distribution . if customers want that , we will be forwarding the lead to ees , probably to doug condon . we would expect ees to do the same thing . i have worked with doug condon in the past . once management has blessed this approach , i will call doug and clarify how we want the approach to work . let me know if you find out that he is the " right " contact person .
the beauty of this approach is that it is clean . the negative is that customers might be contacted by more than one enron employee . i think that is ok , however , as there are good reasons for that . our two companies offer two distinct approaches . we should be making customers aware of this fact when we explain possible solutions and let them decide what is best for them .
let me know if this approach is ultimately adopted .
thanks
