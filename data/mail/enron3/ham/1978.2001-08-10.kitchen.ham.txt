louise ,
i took a meeting with this guy from bloomberg at whalley ' s request . attached is bloomberg ' s idea to set up a power trading company / platform in europe . they would want us to commit trades in exchange for equity . i am not interested in the equity , but i told them i would distribute the idea to the proper people . it is also being floated around the london office . if you want , you can respond to this guy directly or i can take care of it .
