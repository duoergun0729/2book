georgeanne ,
attached below is treasury ' s initial project plan for a full banking system replica for netco . as you will see we have estimated we can be up and running with basic wire functionality by 1 / 23 / 01 and a full system of checks , issuance files , ach ' s and workstation within 93 days . we do reserve the right to amend and or clarify this plan as we have time to complete our due diligence on the full system requirements and the impact of the changes . currently the plan does not include the citibanking installation which will be included as soon as possible and will not extend the project deadline .
regards ,
marcus pullicino
