Subject: power collateral support annex
enclosed are clean and mark revised ( hopefully close to final ) drafts of the eei collateral annex and cover sheet . most of the changes were made to add securities as eligible collateral . this has not yet been done on the cover sheet since it is in a special format that i couldn ' t figure out . it will be done tomorrow . please call or e - mail me with any remaining comments as we need to finalize this as early as possible tomorrow . thanks .

i left the cover sheet in your chair with the changes that need to be made . can you please make those changes ? thanks .
