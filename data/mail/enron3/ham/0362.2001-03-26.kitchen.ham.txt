Subject: re : still working on it but here ' s where we are
we can talk about it at 10 : 00 am , however , i do not think the split will work as you propose . the vast majority of the industrial process load uses more than 25 mw on peak which is and should continue to be the focus of ena . the target companies and sites we will focus on down here will average somewhere in the 10 - 20 mw peak range ( remember , non - process load , aggregation of sites ) .
after ees bought back the minority shareholders , there has been increasing overlap in the marketplace between ees / ena . the reasoning behind deliniating where and how each group will focus was to alleviate the external overlap , reduce any friction between the groups , and increase both groups productivity .
i don ' t think there should be any issue on the fertilizer companies , but i ' ll doublecheck .
talk to you at 10 : 00 am .
