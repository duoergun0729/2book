i think it is a mistake but if we need to hit a number it is doable - if amy can provide the support by always having a line of communication open and visiting portland every few weeks

louise ,
on reflection , when i sent you my hr team list yesterday , i made decision in order to get within 9 , i would cover portland and calgary hr from houston . before we proceed on the basis of that team i need chris and tim to agree they are ok with this . milnthorp says he ' s happy , so long as estate or our new parent provides payroll and benefits services ( which i believe they will ) .
i would be happy to keep julie kearney on my list but i really don ' t know if i can drop one of the others which would obviously push my team to 10 overall ( this is down from 14 or 15 , depending on which list you look at ) . .
