subject : total deal
we have a capesized vessel of 150 , 000 mt plus or minus ten percent of south african steamcoal that we asbolutely need to ship to keep the business going . we are delivering the coal to rotterdam against contracts with our long term german customers and have a purchase price of 28 . 50 usd per metric tonne basis 6000 kcal / kg nar and an average sales price of net back equivalent of 2 . 50 usd per metric tonne profit margin . so the pnl on the deal would be 375 , 000 usd pnl positive . the vessel is loading approx 20 the december 2001 .
due to credit issues we have agreed the following subject our approval .
pre - pay 300 , 000 usd to parent company totalfina elf - needs to be paid in the next 1 - 2 days .
then either pre - pay the full value of the cargo ca 4 . 272 million usd , or set - up standby letter of credit , both 3 days prior to loading . ( i . e . 17 th dec )
this week peter abdo and i have met three banks and are working with them to give l / c capacity specifically based around our international coal flows . we have absa
bank looking at raising the l / c on this deal specifically and are confident that they will do so , such that the pre - pay on full value will not be required
please can we get approval for the initial prepay of 300 , 000 usd in the next 1 - 2 days . we have in place a total fina elf parent company guarantee for good measure .
thanks in advance
