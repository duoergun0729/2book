Subject: description of ubs deal
louise - -
i need to understand exactly what data is and what data is not being transferred from enron to ubs . if any of the data is viewed by ferc as being jurisdictional assets , than enron would need to inform ferc of that transfer before the transfer . clearly , customer specific data will create more issues than generic market information . i need to check what happens if you have deleted the counterparty names but still show detailed trading data .
who can help me get a better handle on this on monday ?
also , i understand the " adoption " by ubs of enron contracts . initially i was under the impression that this was simply a " review " . again , any transfer of a jurisdictional asset would result in a 203 application by enron . i have seen one draft of the interim agreement , but assume that you would do this for eei and other physical contracts . am i right ?
thanks ,
jim

the master agreement and license agreement mention that you have " customer data " . is this wrong ?

simply
people , systems and floor space .
back to front applications with no specific counterparty data . we have historical pricing etc but no counterparty names . you could get most of it from reuters .

how would you describe ( in terms that a regulator would understand ) what is transfered to ubs ? i am asking because i want to make sure that i have a good grasp of what is going to ubs before our ferc pre - meeting .
my understanding is that we are providing software code to is used ( a ) for all backoffice applications and ( b ) for a trading platform . anything else ?
