mou has its day
sources report that california senator polanco has introduced the legislation today for the mou between the governor and socal edison ( sb 78 xx ) . as reported earlier , sources still believe that there is not sufficient legislative support for this measure to pass . senator polanco ' s political career was earlier jeopardized by personal scandal and now sources feel his mou sponsorship may be nothing more than a quid pro quo attempt to gain support from davis . additionally , the cpuc has added two necessary mou provisions to its next week voting agenda , though support for these issues remains weak on the cpuc board .
house energy relief efforts
the house energy and commerce committee gave up plans to ease california ' s energy woes because republicans and democrats could not settle a long standing debate over price caps in the west . representative waxman admitted a compromise was never more than a noble idea throughout the debates , and several delayed mark - up sessions for the bill . barton noted the bill had little chance of aid california considering the time it would take to pass the bill would be longer than the california summer .
