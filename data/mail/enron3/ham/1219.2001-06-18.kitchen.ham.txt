chaps ,
the team have identified 17 manager and director level commercial candidates which we are looking to bring in for a super - saturday type event primarily for duran ' s area . we ' ll refine list and may see some fall out before the ( yet to be arranged ) day .
it seems some of these guys may be of interest to egm as well . unless you have a huge problem the plan would be to invite per sekse and maybe someone from nowlan ' s area to join the panel . maybe they will want one or two that we don ' t .
do you want to interview ?
