louise -
we ' ve negotiated an mou with alstom that has helped us fix the purchase price for cfb based power plants . it does not commit us to spend any money today ; it ' s really just a strong guideline for what the epc will look like .
having said that , alstom considers it a big deal , and they are flying in some heavies from paris for the signing ceremony . the guy below is the lead person from paris . additionally , fritz gautschi , alstom ' s country president will be coming .
bottom line : it ' s tentatively scheduled for the morning of 17 october here in houston . if you and dave are available , i ' ll coordinate . you won ' t need to sign , just provide some presence . there ' s still some flexibility if that day doesn ' t work for you .
thanks ,
mitch
