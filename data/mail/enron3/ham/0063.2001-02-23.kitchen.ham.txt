louise ,
no hi how are you doing ? no how is it going up there in portland ? you just come in and go right for the west desk ' s eol jugular .
as everyone knows , the west power desk has a spotty record , at best , on maintaining eol volumes . there are some good reasons for this and some lame , tired excuses which i ' m sure we will discuss in great detail in the near future .
i currently don ' t get the ice reports and will make sure i am on the distribution . from what our traders tell me and what the report that you sent indicates , ice is having an even harder time in the west than we are . it looked like there were two one - month deals on ice that day totalling 20 , 000 mwh . in contrast , we had 87 transactions totalling 269 , 000 mwh . if i ' m reading it right , the ice report actually makes us look good by comparison !

we look at ice volume reports every day and they are doing about 10 - 20 % of the volumes ( and # transactions ) we are doing on eol . we are doing 300 - 350 transactions per day in east power and ice does approx . 45 - 50 transactions per day .
