at louise ' s request we have added some " disclaimer " text at the bottom of the splash page that will be released when we are ready to start re - signing customers . the intent is to assure customers that their registration forms , etc . will not be used should the deal btwn . ubs and enron not go through .
please review the disclaimer ( below , or you can view the entire splash page via this link - https : / / hyperion . eoltest . com : 8143 / new _ jsp / marketing / temp _ register / index . html ) and send your comments to kal or me .
in the event that the above - mentioned transaction between ubs warburg and enron is not closed , all customer registration forms , password applications and electronic trading agreements received by ubswenergy will be considered null and void and will not be transferred to any subsequent entity .
