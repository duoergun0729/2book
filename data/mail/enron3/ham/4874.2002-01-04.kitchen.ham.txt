we have had a lot of discussion on the contractual arrangements we would need to put in place in order to recommence trading as quickly as possible . i am working on producing a fuller list for you today . however , there is one particular contract / licence which does require special treatment - power marketing licence to be granted by ferc . in order to ensure that we start this process as quickly as possible we are looking to complete the filing documentation in advance of the bankruptcy decision on our future .
our current strategy is as follows ( all dates are approximate )
present - january 10 th , 2002 complete filing documentation
january 11 th visit with ferc ( one of senior executives here plus a senior executive from our buyer )
january 13 th file and request an expedited process
it would be extremelly helpful if you could identify someone for the head of our regulatory group ( jim steffes ) to co - ordinate with at citi .
thanks
