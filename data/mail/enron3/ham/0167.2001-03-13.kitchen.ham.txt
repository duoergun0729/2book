Subject: update on cinergy
dave ,
we received a little inside information on cinergy ( no guarantee if reflective of corporate view , but insightful non the less ) . the feedback indicates that holding firm in our " no run " stance is the best position to take at this time .
apparently this " run / no run " issue is partly an internal political issue between houston and cincinnati , whereby the operators in cincinnati think tang and vivar cut a bum deal on this remedial work issue which allowed these modifications ( bearing and silencer at brownsville , control curves at caledonia ) but did not require any testing . it appears the guys in cincinnati are posturing such that if the machines break or don ' t work as planned , the blame would then fall on tang and vivar ( this helps explain why tang is so adamant about running ) . the view was that given this , ultimately the psa rules and running is not required .
let me know if you need any more color .
thanks for your help .
