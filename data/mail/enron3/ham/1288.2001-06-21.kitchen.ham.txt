Subject: vitro
regarding the attached email , don asked me to relay the following response . first , it is relatively unlikely that the idb will conclude that their approval is not necessary ( according to maria elena the need for idb consent is unambiguous ) . second , even if the idb suggests that their approval is not necessary , there is another material condition precedent , cfc consent . the cfc is the mexican equivalent of the federal trade commission in the united states and consent from the cfc is not expected for forty five days after filing ( filing is anticipated for june 29 , 2001 ) . maria elena is currently visiting with cris sherman to discuss our ability to book income given these two items and will get back with you shortly . please feel free to call with anything further .

if idb comes back today and says that the board of idb does not need to approve this sale to tractebel , they will probably still need to see docs etc . but can we book it ( this quarter ? )
