i have hired an ees manager ( nick politis ) to fill a mid - market role in east power . subsequent to hiring the candidate , i learned from kim melodick that you and / or lavo may want to screen all commercial hires before extending offers . i spoke with dave duran before extending the offer . it is dave ' s understanding that you and john l . will screen director level and above . mr . politis was interviewed by 6 commercial people from e . power . please let me know if you have a problem with this issue . in addition , if you could provide guidance on commercial hiring protocol , i would appreciate it . hope this isn ' t an inconvenience .
