subject : business cards for newco employees
tammie - - happy new year . i am preparing a plan for designing / printing collateral materials ( stationary , envelopes , etc . ) for newco since we will need to do a big mailing announcing the new trading web site .
it occured to me that newco employees will want new business cards as well . is the buyer going to handle printing business cards for us ? if not , i can help mock up some designs and talk to some printers about getting them printed quickly . my thought was that we send out an e - mail to employees ( around jan 14 th ) with an order form where employees can put in their business card info . and submit to me . our group can collect all the orders and hire a printer to do one mass business card print run . this will save money and create a consistent look for business cards . when you can , pls . let me know what you think .
thanks
