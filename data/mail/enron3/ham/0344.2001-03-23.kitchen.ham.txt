this will be a frequent report until we get all the quotes up and running . in most cases , the missing quotes were quickly available through a direct phone call . i left a mesage with presto , and he responded via message last night saying he would investigate the ercot , but that fletch was overwhelmed on the cin and comed . he would talk to the ny team and discuss the reasonableness of the deliverables . he came to the conclusion that they definately need more traders across the board to keep the backs and offpeaks fresh , but they do not have them now . i will continue to monitor the progress .
