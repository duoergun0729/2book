louise ,
quick follow - up on allegheny , just in case you get a call today . i have come to learn that peter skrgic is now the former president of allegheny energy supply , having just retired in the last month . he has been replaced by mike morrell , who is also the cfo , until someone can be found to replace him . morrell should be very familiar with allegheny ' s financing plan for these assets .
to the extent that you want to pass the detailed financing conversation on to me , i am more than happy to have that conversation with morrell . also , just so you know , apparently goldman is going to be the lead banker on the equity offering .
let me know if you hear anything or have any questions .
thanks ,
don
