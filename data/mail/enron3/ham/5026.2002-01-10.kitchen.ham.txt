david -
tana expressed concern last night that sally beck ' s world doesn ' t seem to have much direction and with bob hall deciding not to go to netco , there is a lot of talk / speculation about why he is not going .
just wanted to bring this to your attention - lavo asked that we add sally back on the netco list , but then said for us not to tell her . i think with bob ' s departure , we need to identify and communicate who the lead is so that the team can be given direction and get things back on track .
let me know your thoughts - any help that you can give would be greatly appreciated .
