Subject: louise , i dont think i can be the eol guy for the floor . its just not going to work like the zie projects . they have other priorities and a different attitude . i you want to talk about it give me a call or we can talk next monday .
the zie projects are coming along fine : basis opts port calc is done and being tested by us . flex deal viewer coming along , probably done by the end of the month . transport options and option reports are under development . going to talk to zie about sitara reliability cause we will have a trader revolt if it crashes again .
