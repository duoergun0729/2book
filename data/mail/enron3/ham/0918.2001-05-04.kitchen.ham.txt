louise ,
it is my understanding that we will be buying the gas in argentina from either the northern or eastern end of enap ' s production system in the magallenes region of chile , down near the tiera del fuego . i know that there is an interconnect point to purchase gas off tgs at the northern end of enap ' s system . nonetheless , you will find attached the presentation that the south american office put together for our visit with enap ' s management regarding enron ' s presence in south america and the terms & conditions for a notional gas marketing agreement ( the last three slides ) . this was set up for delivery into tgs as outlined . i have a call into federico as well and will provide any further clarification if necessary . don ' t hesitate to call with any other questions . we should have the revised letter agreement with enap signed up within the next week .
thanks ,
chris
