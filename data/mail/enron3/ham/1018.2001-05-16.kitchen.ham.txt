where do we stand now ? last i heard was an e - mail from oxley ( which is on lotus notes and not accessible anymore ) which said that we don ' t think that we are going to get there , but hold on for a few more days while we finalize our decision and craft a really nice decline speech . it ' s been a few weeks now , and i am checking status . do you still want to offer him the initial contract ? i doubt he ' d take it but i need to know . what would you change with his proposal that would be acceptable ? i think that mike has taken this negotiation seriously and deserves a timely resolution .
