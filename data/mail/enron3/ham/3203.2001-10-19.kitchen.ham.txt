louise ,
i can ' t tell you how excited i am to do it . i also get the great pleasure of saying who i am working on it for along with working for you at work .
it is taking a long time , as we bought a travel trailer and have been working on getting it ready for the deer lease . i ' ve decided ( like that authority ) when its finally complete that ' s when we ' ll have y ' all over for dinner and present it to you then . tell me who your framer is , as i will have more items to frame down the road .
p . s . i showed you my son ' s christmas stocking it took me a year to complete it and i was traveling a lot and used many flights as stitching time .
thanks again for being # 17 ! i am very excited for you .
best regards ,
bobbi
