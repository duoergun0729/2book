Subject: turbine swap
louise ,
looks like the $ wont show until wednesday , then we give notice to turbopark , wait five business days , transfer the turbines and get the $ from the escrow account . jake spoke directly with hancock - they said they are done , but we have 24 hours for the escrow approval , then hancock has a 24 hour notice period to release the funds . . . hence wednesday .
