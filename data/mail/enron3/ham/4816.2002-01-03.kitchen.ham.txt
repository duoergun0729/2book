Subject: re : list of topn 50 counterparties
here is a start on the list . we have a meeting with ubs in the am to review as well . obviously , i am putting limits that we would be willing to extend from a credit perspective only . taking into account liquidity and commercial drivers may adjust these numbers . let me know if you would like to discuss .
regards ,
bill
