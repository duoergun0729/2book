absolutely agree with dave . any services agreement should be invisible to the market and newco should be seen as the conterparty . the services agreement should just pertain to the time that newco does not have the staff to service it . . . as short as time as possible .

guys , the nature , term , etc of any such agreement will have to be agreed to by jeff mcmahon . i would not be supportive of any long - term services agreement without a very close examination of the economics . a term agreement , at the right price , where newco continues to control the business relationship and optionality may be a win - win and provide maximum benefit to the estate .

in order to get peoples up and running as soon as possible - we will need ( as netco ) to enter into a service agreement with the estate - can you set this up with don or jim .
