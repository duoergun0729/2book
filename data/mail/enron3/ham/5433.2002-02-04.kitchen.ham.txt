Subject: canadian regulatory approvals
further to my previous email , competition act canada and investment canada act approvals are currently contemplated as conditions to closing .
we ( ecc ) have provided ubs and its counsel with all information and warranties that they need to convince themselves that no pre - closing approvals are needed in the circumstances ( they only need to make a post - closing notification ) , but it is ultimately their decision , and we have yet to hear back from their counsel , although we don ' t anticipate any problem .
