Subject: fw : service bureau prohibitions
hi louise / jay
if you can help shed any light on your vendor relationship with legato
and rational , and whether you believe there is scope for reviewing
these licenses with a view to changing the relevant license agreements ,
that would be extremely helpful . we understand that both these
products would be critical components to running the netco systems .
thx

thanks bert . as promised , i am following up with e company on the
various
assigned agreements that prohibit providing service to a third party .
feel
free to have ursula pursue the question simultaneously . i am also
looking
into what services the parties intend fire to provide for transition as
this is not a part of the transaction that i have been following
closely to
date .

the two licenses are :
1 . enterprise software license agreement between legato
systems , inc . and [ e ] corp , dated as of sept . 27 , 2001 , respecting
numerous software products generally branded with the names
networker , gems , celestra , octopus and others . section 2 . 2
provides : " restrictions on use . licensee shall not , and shall
not aid , abet or permit any third party to : . . . ( iii ) . . . use
for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise use . . .
the software . . . for the benefit of third parties . . . . "
2 . products license agreement # 3185 modified for [ e ]
corp , issued by ration software corp . , dated as of feb . 17 , 1998 ,
respecting various software products branded clearcase , rational ,
purify , and quantify and others . section 1 . 1 provides : " general
grant of license . . . . you may not rent , lease or use the product
in a service bureau capacity . . . . . "
we continue to review the agreements for the service
bureau issue as it is the most pressing from a time perspective .
we have already found several ambiguous licenses and will bring
those to your attention as a group later .
if other express provisions such as the above turn up , i
will let you know on a case by case basis as this issue is one our
it personnel are taking seriously .
