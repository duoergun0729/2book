we have a # of counterparties whom credit will allow daily trading and / or balance of month trading ( with no forward trading ) . it would be much more efficient for the trading organization and the counterparties to have functionality within eol that allowed for better credit screening . we have moved away from the broker markets , and the current screening mechanism forces us to trade in the broker market with credit limited counterparties .
i would like to get this changed asap , if possible .
thanks .

as i mentioned to you , due to some recent success in obtaining additional security , we are extending credit to edison mission marketing & trading , inc . to transact on the day ahead and balance of week markets only . we will not be granting them execution rights on eol due to the lack of controls / functionality for daily transactions . eol , unlike ice , has tenor function set by months versus number of days . as a result , in the case of edison mission , if we set eol for one month , edison would have access to balance of the month plus next month . it seems to make this work for edison and perhaps other potential counterparties , it would either require reengineering of the system or possibly coming up with dividing the products to incorporate daily transactions . if you would like to discuss further , please call .
