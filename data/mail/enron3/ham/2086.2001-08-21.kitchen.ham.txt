in a nutshell :
the governor and assembly leadership ( without rod wright ) have reached
agreement and believe they have the 41 votes to support the below :
o there will be a $ 2 . 9 billion bailout that can be used to pay the qf ' s and
the banks , but not the generators - either directly or indirectly - and will be
recovered through a dedicated rate component charged to consumers 20 kwh and
above .
o business and consumer interests are being briefed at the moment by the
staff of davis and angelides on the proposal .
o the easement language is consistent with the language proposed in 78 xx
o the renewable portfolio standard language is primarily consistent with
82 xx however discussions on final language are continuing now .
o regarding the transmission lines and direct access , language has not been
written and discussions are also continuing . in fact much of the bill is
being drafted now and is said to circulate tomorrow among members . davis
has indicated that he wants a vote as soon as thursday
o the senate has not agreed , but there are staff meetings going on now .
o the cpuc has not involved in the discussions , but the administration
continues to assure that no cpuc action will be taken in contrary to the
language of the bill .
please feel free to call with questions and as always we will keep you
posted .
