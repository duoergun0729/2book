Subject: re : drift
louise - let me clarify a point i obviously mangled in my previous email . we are going to change gary ' s drift allocation amounts to north america . i talked to mike about this yesterday and he agrees the current allocation is aggressive . i need to talk to gary on thursday about these changes and if nothing else , give him a heads up that we are going to do this . the costs allocated to you related to drift will definitely be reduced and i will have the revised numbers for you on thursday .
regards ,
brent

clearly this is an incorrect allocation . gary is allocating north america for 19 people for just managing drift .
it has now taken two months to get nowhere on this issue .
i revert back to mike for resolution on this .

louise - current status on drift expense allocations . . . . we have reviewed the $ 11 . 8 million in question and that amount is correct given the methodology being used by gary to allocate costs . when gary is back in the office on thursday , i will go through his allocations with him to determine if we need to change that methodology and thus change the allocation percentages . i will let you know the outcome of that meeting .
also , keep in mind that the $ 11 . 8 million represents a plan amount . actuals should be much less since we are currently well under plan headcount amounts and not all plan expenses have been made . let me know if you have any questions - i will keep you updated .
