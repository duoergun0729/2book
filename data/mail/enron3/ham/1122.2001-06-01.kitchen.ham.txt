hey ! hope you ' re doing well and getting some sleep . john asked me to send you an e - mail concerning the move of dick lydecker under the wholesale investing effort headed by kevin garland . i have attached the april assets listing for your reference . it was john ' s sense that he would want to place certain assets under dick which aren ' t currently his , such as aig and maybe even bridgeline . we should probably make some cut that could be different than the existing owners . other investments of note : onondaga
all of mike miller ' s stuff ( i assume including destec )
some of redmond ' s retained assets ( see p . 4 )
east coast power loan - - $ 30 mm
all of the clo investments
these would all be candidates to move some of which might land with dick anyway . i think john just wanted you thinking about this . call me if you have thoughts or need further info . by the way , i scanned other b / s accounts and nothing exists there which should be moved
