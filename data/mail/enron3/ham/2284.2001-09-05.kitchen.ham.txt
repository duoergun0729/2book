so , it all came to pass . per our discussion a long time ago - i am now having the problems envisaged with ibuyit . i have never received an approval request from any of my direct reports . i have contacted the ibuyit team and asked why not ? has no - one reporting to me ordered anything ? the response from the team was that they were unable to tell me what the issue was and that i should ask each one of my direct reports to look at the system next time and tell me who they were sending their applications to . the ibuyit administration team cannot assess this information ( isc helpline ) .
please help this is very frustrating - i am trying to be pro - active but its hard .
