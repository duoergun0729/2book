dave ,
i left you a voice mail about this . i like version 2 and it will be the one which is the most likely to go with the activex control and require the least number of site changes . i don ' t have a problem with the ubs colors in general . i do not believe we have enough time to make their colors work correctly . in the next version , we can do it right .
let me know what you think on this .

attached please find copy of the 6 designs that we came up with .
- ubsengergy 2 will be the best one that flows well with the rest of the site .
- ubsengery 5 , and ubsenergy 8 will complement well with the orange navigation on the trading page .
heather has asked us to come up with 6 and 7 with red navigation . this color absolutely will not go with the active - x . as we discussed yesterday , we will not being able to make any changes on the active - x .
please call me if you have any questions . we will need your decision by the end of the day today .
thanks .
