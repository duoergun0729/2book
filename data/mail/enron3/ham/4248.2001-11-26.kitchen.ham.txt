rick
thanks for your encouraging words during the last few days . i have to say that despite all the difficulties we have had to endure over the past few months , enron remains the best place i have ever worked . this is due , in no small part , to the great people i share this place with .
i also owe you an overdue e - mail on the mexico matter . as i had indicated , i have decided not to take the offer . i have spoken to a number of friends and associates who live in monterrey and their views are pretty unanimous : monterrey is a great place to live if one is already settled with a family , but it is altogther different and more difficult for a single man . therefore , despite the professional opportunity to work with a great team , i have decided not accept the offer .
many thanks for keeping me in mind , being patient , and moving things along . i will be in touch in the next couple of days . enjoy your holiday .
best regards ,
paul
