Subject: re : contracts address list
umbrella is still requiring this type of information to be scheduled . although our position is currently not to provide it , we may alter the position and i am trying to get a head start since the time frames are shortening . they will eventually want this on all counterparties , but we can start with the top twenty . further , early next week andy alter wants to discuss how we will contract initially . mark taylor and i will discuss this with him , but it will be vital to have contact information ready sooner rather than later . thanks for your help .
