louise :
that is good news . in mexico and probably elsewhere in latin america , we can use this unit for information gathering purposes in return for a quantifiable risk since o & m agreements are typically capped in terms of overall exposure . it may be tough to break into third - party projects ( assuming we would want to strategically ) , but at least on projects that we initiate , we can keep a handhold even after we sell down our equity stake .
