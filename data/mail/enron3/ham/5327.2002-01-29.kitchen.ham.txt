simply

back to front applications with no specific counterparty data . we have historical pricing etc but no counterparty names . you could get most of it from reuters .

how would you describe ( in terms that a regulator would understand ) what is transfered to ubs ? i am asking because i want to make sure that i have a good grasp of what is going to ubs before our ferc pre - meeting .
my understanding is that we are providing software code to is used ( a ) for all backoffice applications and ( b ) for a trading platform . anything else ?
