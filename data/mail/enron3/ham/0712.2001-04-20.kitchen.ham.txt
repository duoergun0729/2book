i ' m a bit confused - i think that the current document distributed for circulation is too small . i would suggest this be abandonned and a next draft produced which includes the following .
single deal entry revisions
options reports
transport valuation in erms
eol reporting tools ( possible )
i would like to see phase ii include the items above and an inception document re - issued this week .
thanks
