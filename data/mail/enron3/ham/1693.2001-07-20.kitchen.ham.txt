Subject: ea event master schedule
attached is the enron americas master schedule of events for 2001 .
the approval process that was established in ea has enabled my department to easily track event costs and provide overall savings by leveraging the fees for items such as hotel rates , audio / visual , transportation and printing charges .
i will update this schedule after each quarter .
please let me know if you have any questions or require additional information .
thanks .
