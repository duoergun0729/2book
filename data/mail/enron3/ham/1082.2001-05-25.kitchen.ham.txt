Subject: analyst & associate program - summer interns
i want to take a moment to thank each of you for having a summer analyst or associate work on your team . i also want to remind everyone what a high stakes activity this is for enron .
based on your recommendation , we will make offers at the end of the summer to those interns who perform , and who you endorse as a potential future member of your team . those interns who have had a good experience and accept our offer will be the lowest risk hires we make - from any source . we will have effectively interviewed and watched them work for 2 - 3 months . they also have the potential to be the most effective advocates and talent scouts we have , when they return to campus . on the flip side , those who don ' t have meaningful assignments , or have bad experiences during the summer can severely hurt our efforts .
thank you again for being part of this very important activity . if you have any questions , or if areas of concern arise during the summer , please contact ted bland ( x 35275 ) , traci warner ( x 33242 ) or me ( x 36671 ) .
we appreciate your contributions to this important effort for enron .
