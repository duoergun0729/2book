Subject: marcello has a favour to ask . . . .
he ' s on the executive impact & influence course on 6 th & 7 th november and marcello being marcello has been a bit tardy in selecting his raters ( well , i actually ended up doing once he ' d told me who to pick ! ) .
the thing is because he ' s picked the minimum no . of raters it ' s important that those few give the feedback on him - yep you ' ve guessed it , you ' re one of the few .
apparently the feedback needs to be done by tuesday so please may i ask you to do your best to give feedback on him .
thank you and i hope you & the family are all well
ttfn
