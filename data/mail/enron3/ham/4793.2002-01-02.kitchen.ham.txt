Subject: 2002 tx orig budget
faith :
please find the attached budget for tx gas orig per louise ' s request . i have compared the budget distributed by david vandor to the budget submitted to the office of the chair last september ( adjusted for a smaller head count ) . this is located under the natural gas orig - texas tab in the attached spreadsheet .
my main comments are as follows :
1 . travel and entertainment seems a bit low as we need to be meeting with / signing up / marketing to a new customer base .
2 . netco will need to pay for outside engineering and technical services as our in - house staff has been reduced ( pipeline mapping , flow analysis )
3 . the supplies number for netco seems low given past expenditures .
please call or email me if you need anything else .
