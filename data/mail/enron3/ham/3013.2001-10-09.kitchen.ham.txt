Subject: jeff huff resume
the resume for jeff huff was inadvertently dropped from the message we sent yesterday evening . the resume is attached below for your convenience .
below are a few points for your review :
resume : currently the second most productive partner at diamond - cluster , a technology consulting firm . he has been a consultant dedicated to enron for the last 2 + years , first for tom gros in ebs and net works and then for dan reck in freight , developing trading systems .
the job : we are looking to bring jeff in as vp , commercial support . the demands of growing the group require a consistent focus on technology , expenses , front and back office productivity , as well as constant re - analysis of growth strategies .
justification : jeff ' s capabilities in these areas make him extremely qualified . we rely on him heavily already , but at consulting rates he costs us more than $ 1 . 3 mm per year and his focus is limited to technology . most importantly , the lead commercial folks in the group are overburdened with administrative issues and spending too little time bringing in earnings .
thank you .
mike and jeff
