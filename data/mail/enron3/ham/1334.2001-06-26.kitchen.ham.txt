Subject: re : assistance with a presentation
l
thanks got a copy of several presentations . looks like morale is pretty down in the us and london and the picture is looking too bright for the next six months .
things are going well on this side of the world as we stay on track for our targets this year . brought in two originators , rob stewart from project dolphin , and martin webb , who was in the uk office before going to spain , to help build a more physical profile in the market . working on making australia a good news story for growth and see the potential for some large global products deals - just got to convert potential to $ $ $ .
see you sometime in q 3 .
cheers
paul
