Subject: ncph coal contract
wes ,
just a note to confirm that on behalf of ncph , the llc that owns the elizabethtown and lumberton coal facilities in north carolina , we have entered into a eight year contract with the coal desk . for lack of an index , the contract is a cost based requirements contract which provides for physical delivery of coal to the lumberton handling facility . the contract also allows ncph to lock prices at an offer in - lieu of cost as we have done for the balance of 2001 for $ 72 / ton in order to manage the cpl off take agreement . presently this is an intercompany transaction as ncph is a wholly owned subsidiary of ena with accrual treatment , however this contract is part of the sale of ncph to aig which will yield a true third party contract and mtm treatment . the negotiations of the spa and other agreements are going well and we will keep you apprised .
regards ,
ozzie pagan
