greg / louise : our best middle marketer , howard sangwine ( $ 5 mm orig - 2001 ) is considering leaving to reliant . if we were to offer him a contract with $ 25 / 25 , i believe he would stay . this guy is critical to our start - up plans ( ie getting contracts signed ) as he has relationships with the entire cdn e & p sector . pls advise

lavo , we may lose sangwine to reliant ( promo to director , $ 50 k sign - on ) . i think we could keep him if we gave him a contract with $ 25 / $ 25 . pls advise
