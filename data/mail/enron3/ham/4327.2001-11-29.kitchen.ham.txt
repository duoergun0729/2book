the collapse of the proposed enron / dynegy merger has sent a shock wave through
the industry but does not threaten the effective functioning of wholesale gas
and power markets in north america . major market participants have had more
than a month to unwind positions with enron , and thus the overall exposure has
been greatly reduced .
* wholesale gas and power markets in north america continue to function
effectively . there is no reason for the physical flow of gas or power to be
impeded this winter .
* liquidity for longer - term structured products has temporarily been reduced .
others will move in to fill the gap , but this will take time .
* enron ' s problems do not represent a critical blow to deregulating gas and
power markets .
we are sending this alert to global energy clients also because of enron ' s
major role in the us gas and power markets .
* * end * *
