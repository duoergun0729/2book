Subject: resignations and estate
louise ,
in the event that some of the people who are being offered positions in ubs do not take them , but instead resign , and we therefore keep someone in ubs who otherwise would have gone to the estate , i thought we should agree potential bonuses .
to be clear : these bonuses would be paid only if the individual wound up going to ubs instead of the estate as currently planned .
if you agree , please let me know and forward to amy fitzpatrick . this should allow us to respond quickly as events develop .
name estate contingent bonus
