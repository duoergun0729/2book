Subject: revised cover memo
john and louise ,
i have taken john ' s draft and added a few thoughts , including the issue of what happens if there is not a new agreement with counterparty ( the enron agreement remains in effect ) , the possibility that the new entity may not hire everyone , and the concept that they transfer to the new entity upon closing .
let me know your thoughts .
