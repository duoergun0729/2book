Subject: re : aig highstar
louise , we have discontinued any material work for aig regarding their acquisition of tm ventures . we will , however , advise them regarding the liquidation value of the 2 qf projects that they would be acquiring . this will not require any time or effort on our part and is compatible with the overall agreement with aig . i do believe that the concept of creating a customer for enron has the potential to create value for us and does not create any incremental risk . hope all is going well .
