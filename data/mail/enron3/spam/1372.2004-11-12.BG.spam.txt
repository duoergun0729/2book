Subject: hello friend
from mr . michael siisi ,
greetings to you ,
before i introduce myself , i wish to inform you that this letter is not
a hoax mail and i urge you to treat it serious . this letter must come to
you as a big surprise , but i believe it is only a day that people meet and
become great friends and business partners . my name is mr . michael siisi ,
the present branch manager of a bank here in ghana . i write you this proposal
in good faith , believing that i can trust you with the information i am
about to reveal to you . like i said , i have a transaction that will benefit
both of us , as your assistance is required as a foreigner .
i use to head the accounts department in my bank head office , but last december
i was asked to take position of a manager of our branch in kumasi who passed
on , so that was how i became the present manager and discovered a fortune .
as i resumed duty , i discovered an account with total sum of $ 12 , 500 , 000
million that has not been operated on for the past 4 years . from my investigation ,
i found out that this account belongs to one late mr . morris thompson an
american great industrialist and a resident of alaska , who unfortunately
lost his life in the plane crash of alaska airlines flight 261 which crashed
on january 31 2000 , including his wife and only daughter . you shall read
more news about the crash on visiting this site which i got during my investigation ;
http : / / www . cnn . com / 2000 / us / 02 / 01 / alaska . airlines . list / and http : / / www . nativefederation . org / history / people / mthompson . html
the account is escrow call account , a secret type of account in my bank
and no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it ,
the account has no other beneficiary . i have kept a close monitoring of
the account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about the money
as next of kin to the late mr . morris thompson , meaning that no one is aware
of the account . i cannot directly take out this money without the help
of a foreigner and that is why i am contacting you for an assistance to
claim the funds and share it with me . as the manager of my bank branch ,
i have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner
that comes up as the next of kin to the account , with the correct information
concerning the account , which i shall give you .
i am seeking your co - operation to present you as the next of kin to the
account , so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you . there
is practically no risk involved , the transaction will be executed under
a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law .
if you accept to work with me , i want you to state how you wish us to share
the funds in percentage , so that both parties will be satisfied . contact
me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work together ,
so we can go over the details . thanking you in advance and may god bless
you . please , treat with utmost confidentiality . i wait your urgent response .
you can as well contact me by fax , + 233 27621073 and my phone number is
+ 233208216645 .
regards ,
mr . michael siisi .
