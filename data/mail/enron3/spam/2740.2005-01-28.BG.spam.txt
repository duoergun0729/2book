this money emanated from over - invoicing in the contract awarded to a foreign firm , based on our status as senior government officials in top sensitive position of trust , we cannot stand to claim this money ourselves , hence , i decided to contact you . accordingly , i have consulted and held meetings with some key officials of the federal ministry of finance and central bank of nigeria and we decided to involve a competent partner overseas who could provide facilities for the transfer of the money . all modalities for this transfer have been fully worked out .
we have already secured a preliminary order to effect this payment , we intend to share the money in the following manner : thirty percent for you , sixty percent for us and tenpercent for any miscellaneous expenses .
