to me by our family consultant in regard to your service and profession
as a private clients money manager . ln view
of this , l am interested to entrust some funds under your management .
my name is white fred , i am 22 years old canadian citizen , and the son \ heir
of late fred michael , who was a former united nations official and a very
successful precious stones commodities business tycoon based in west africa
before his death in a plane crash in 2002 .
following the death of my father , a sum of 26 million united states dollar
cash arranged and kept by my father ( with the intention to purchase / procure
tantalities , raw gold and diamond in central africa ) was discovered in safe
deposit boxes in his private security vault , however , the money is now been
inherited by me as his heir and next of kin following his demise , and the
money is now been lodged
in a security firm .
meanwhile , for better investment management of the money , i am interested
in moving the money from the security vault for investment management with
a money manager . hence , l am writing you this letter for expression of interest
to entrust the money under your management and in soliciting your assistance
in moving the money into your custody for management pending the next
three years in which i would have finished my university education . l will
go ahead to present you as the beneficiary of the funds , you will be entitled
