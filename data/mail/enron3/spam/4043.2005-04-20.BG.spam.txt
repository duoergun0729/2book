from mrs nina davidst barts royal hospitalimmeuble bva joseph anoma aveimmercible , abidjanbva 01 bp , côte d ' ivoire .
dearly beloved one , i am mrs . nina david , from kuwait . i am married to late mr samson david , who worked with kuwaitembassy in ivory coast for twenty - seven years before he died in the year 2001 , after a brief illness that lasted for only five days . we were married fornine years with a duaghter ( lilian ) who later died in a motor accident . before the untimely death of my husband , we were both born again christians . since after his death i lost happiness , and decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the bible is against . when my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of ( us $ 2 . 2 m ) ( two million , two hundred thousand unitedstates dollars ) in a general trust account with aprime bank in abidjan cote d ' ivoire . presently , this money is still with
the bank . recently , following myill health , my doctor told me that i may not last for the next seven months despite all that is my possesion due to my cancer problem . the one that disturbs me most is my severe stroke sickness . having known my condition i decided to donate thisfund to a christain organization ( church ) that willutilize this money the way i am going to instruct herein , according to the desire of my late husband before his death . i want this fund to be used in christain activitieslike , orphanages , christain schools , and churches forpropagating the word of god and to endeavor that the house of god is maintained . the bible made us to understand that " blessed is the hand that giveth " , and there is happiness in giving than in receiving . i took this bold decision because i don ' t have any childthat will inherit this money and my husband relativesare not christians and i don ' t want my husband ' s efforts to be used by
unbelievers . i don ' t want a situation where this money will be usedin an ungodly way . this is why i am taking thisdecision . i am not afraid of death hence i know where i am going . i know that i am going to be in the bosom of the lord . exodus 14 vs 14 says that " the lord will fight my case and i shall hold my peace " . i don ' t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of myhusband ' s relatives around me always . i don ' t want them to know about this development . with god all things are possible . as soon as i receive your reply i shall give you the contact of the bank in abidjan . i will also issue you the documents that will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund . i want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard . my happiness is that i lived a life of a worthy christian . and i know my destinaton whoever that wants to serve the lord must serve
him in spirit and truth . please always be prayerful for me and others . pls do send your reply through this below email box : ninadavid 20000 @ yahoo . com . yours in christ , mrs , nina david _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ do you yahoo ! ? tired of spam ? yahoo ! mail has the best spam protection around http : / / mail . yahoo . com
