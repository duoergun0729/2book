i am mr . charles soludo a consulting auditor , nedbank
plc , johannesburg - south africa . during the course of my

discovered an account worth 25 , 400 . 000 . 00 opened in the
bank in 1998 by a foreigner , a german , late mr . andreas

kin known to the bank , according to the immigration data
available to the bank , that i contacted you to stand in as
the next of kin .
i have secretly discussed this matter with a close
confident attorney whom i must involve in order to assist

claims / position of next of kin and also enable us have a
smooth and successful transfer of the fund to any foreign
bank account which you are going to nominate . all validating
and authenticating documents to enable you get this fund
will be carefully worked out . we have secured from the
probate registry , an order of mandamus to locate any of the

risk free .
the sharing ratio after completion of transfer will be
thus : 60 % for me , 35 % for you and 5 % for expensies .

assistance , move the fund to the banks offshore clearing
houses in europe . please note that for the purposes of
