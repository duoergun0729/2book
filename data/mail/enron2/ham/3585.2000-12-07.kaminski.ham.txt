thank you for the presentation to the enron tiger team . it was most
informative and well received by the students . this is an exciting project
and the students are enthusuastic and anxious to begin . many thanks , also ,
for hosting the dinner at the palladium . it was a wonderful opportunity to
get to know more about the project , as well the enron representatives and
the students .
listed below is the contact information with team contacts identified .
i will send you the teams project preferences as soon as i recieve them from
all the students .
it may be a good idea to contact the students before they leave for vacation
( 15 - 22 dec ) to see who is interested in a trip to houston in january for
planning purposes . they will return to campus jan . 16 .
please let me know if there is anything i can do to assist from this end .
