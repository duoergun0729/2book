dear vince ,
1 . i apologize for not having got back to karla
earlier but dauphine is not properly equipped yet .
2 . the conference with samuelson , merton , heath ,
ross , mckean etc was spectacular . 512 academics
and practitioners came to college de france and
were very grateful .
3 . i was so worn out afterwards that i did not make
it to houston . i just went to visit alex after a week
conference on quantitative risk management
where i was speaking at carnegie mellon
4 . another former phd student of mine has been
testing and improving the software . he is great
and modest ; giving the papers i referee and the
conferences i go to , i do believe that we are still
ahead ( or way ahead ) today . we also beautifully
simplified the valuation of the hourly swings .
obviously , in case of a problem , my reputation
and your esteem would be more valuable
than 30 % of 90 , 000 usd ( to be shared . . . )
5 . i declined risk in houston and newyork
and am not sure i will have the pleasure
to see you in london . in all cases , we
should coordinate for paris soon
helyette
