Subject: removal of caps on resale of transmission
on march 16 , martin lin will be participating in a panel discussion with dick
o ' neill of ferc , a rep . of morgan stanley , and ed cazalet of apx on " market
turmoil , trading and risk management " ( harvard electricity group ) . at the
present time , except in several limited regions , marketers do not have the
ability to hedge transmission risk by reselling it above cost . last year , we
approached dick o ' neill ' s staff about the possibility of lifting the cap on
resales of transmission , but they were not inclined to proceed absent the use
of certain restrictions . there have been several recent developments in
power and gas , as discussed in the attached memo . it would be helpful for
martin to discuss these recent orders as necessary in order to attempt to
gain support from dick o ' neill for the idea of lifting the cap for power .
after martin ' s discussion , we should consider reapproaching ferc to seek
approval .
