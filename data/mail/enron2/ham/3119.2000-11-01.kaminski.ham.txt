molly ,
we would like to go ahead with an offer to kenneth . after talking to him
again , i think he will accept .
we would like to offer him the equivalent package to an incoming associate ,
which i understand would be $ 76 k base and a signing bonus of $ 20 k .
he position would be a specialist or senior specialist ( whichever fits the
salary ) reporting to me .
thanks for your help ,
stinson
