dear tanya ,
thank you very much for the offer .
basically , i can start at anytime if the condition is acceptable .
currently i ' m in the middle of a decision that i can extend my internship or
accept a job offer at here . but i think that decision should be done soon
since my original internship expires this week . so the exact time to start
work at enron depends on how quickly i can get your official offer including
employment condition .
i hope this will help to your question . if you have any question on me , please
feel free to contact me .
again , i appreciate your decision .
sincerely ,
jaesoo lew
