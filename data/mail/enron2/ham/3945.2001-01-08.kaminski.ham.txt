Subject: west power model
lance and i spoke with tim heizenrader regarding modeling work and needs for
the west desk . the differences in the markets between east and west are , in
tim ' s opinion , sufficient that he does not need an approach as sophisticated
as the one we are pursuing for ercot . in particular , the termal limits for
which load flows are so useful are not generally binding in the west . loop
flows are also not considered a major issue at present .
in summary , it seems that the west is an unlikely customer of any extension
to an ercot / east transmission model for the time being . they have also done
little in this area that would directly relate to our efforts here .
