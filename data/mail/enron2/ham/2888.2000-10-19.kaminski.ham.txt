Subject: files in houston
hi ,
i am trying to retrieve some analysis that i did while i was in houston . it
is very imporatant that i get these files asap as i need to continue the
correlation analysis for the uk power / gas desk . i have put in a request to
the resolution center in houston to try and get a back up but
would like to know if anyone has any further suggestions ? i was not told that
the files in this folder were periodically deleted .
i think tanya should have a copy of these files but do not know where she is
likely to store them .
thanks in advance ,
kirstee
