Subject: credit business plan
hi jeff ,
my research colleagues and i are working on a document to lay out our credit
derivatives modeling strategy . for lack of a better term , we refer to this
as our credit business plan .
it is my understanding that various business plans have been previously
written for the credit group - one by gillian johnson and another by john
bottomley .
it would be very helpful to our efforts in the research group , it you would
allow us to see these plans .
thanks ,
iris
