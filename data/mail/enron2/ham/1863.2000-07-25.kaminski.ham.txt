ed ,
we are set with a evaluation of the service covering the period from
monday to thursday july 31 to aug 3 . we will activate the web access on
friday afternoon and initiate calls monday morning . the call schedule is :
short range : 8 : 40 east coast time
mid range : 9 : 20 east coast time
if there is a conflict with these times , please notify me . we will need a
number to call into , typically we call directly onto the trading floor . the
username and password are the same as the initial viewing :
username : enron
password : stroso 0 ( zero zero )
it is important to make the point this is for evaluation purposes since we
are not under a contract with liability issues addressed .
i am sure enron will love it like the rest of our clients ! !
