Subject: request for training session
folks ,
i am a vice president with enron , and have been with the company some 6 years
now . i was hired through enron associate pool , and started off by marketing
power on the east coast with jim fallon . currently i am working in the india
region , looking into different ways to develop merchant type activities in
india , anticipating the start of trading activities some time in the future .
one of my challenges is to make the team in india aware of the type of
sophisticated operations and processes that we have in place for trading
activities , as well as the range of products we have to offer .
i have been in conversation with mike mcconnell and jeff shankman on the
global products side , and are planning a session to acquaint the team in
india with activities in that group . similarly , on the power side , we have
been interacting with john sherriff ' s team in london .
i feel that it will be very beneficial for some of the team members to get
acquainted with the processes on the power trading side in houston , and to
get an idea of the rac process , the research side , the back - offices , as well
as the trading operations here . similarly , the team there could present to
you the state of the market in india , and give you an idea of the type of
opportunities there . i am therefore eliciting your support to put together a
session in houston where they can be acquainted with these functions , as well
as the people responsible for them in the us . there are three people in the
group who would benefit from this exposure . one of them is from the
associate pool , while the other two are people hired locally in india .
i have already spoken with our coo , wade cline in this regard , and seek your
support in putting together an agenda for such a session . please let me know
who i should contact within your groups to discuss this further .
regards ,
sandeep .
