Subject: re : recommendation for john gordon
vince ,
thanks for your quick action on this . i try to be selective about sending
out recommendations proactively , but in john ' s case i am very confident that
he will add a lot of value to whoever hires him . on a different topic i was
pleased to see that you will also be on the eprm program again in the fall .
