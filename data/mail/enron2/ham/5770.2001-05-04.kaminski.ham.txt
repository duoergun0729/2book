mike ,
i work for enron transportation and storage in their storage marketing group . my group has been using technical analysis from your website to help make daily storage trading revenue decisions . on your web site , you indicated you would be discontinueing some of the information we use . we had interviewed external technical service profiders , and chose not to buy their service because we had your information available to us to help us make financial decisions . specifically , we need the candlestick charts and analysis on natural gas , and we also need the elliot wave analysis on natural gas .
can you please reconsider your decision to discontinue the technical analysis data aforementioned ?
