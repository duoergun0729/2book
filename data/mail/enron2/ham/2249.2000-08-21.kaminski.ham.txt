Subject: colored printer taj mahal
hello everyone .
this memo only applies to the research group on the 19 th floor that use
the colored printer " taj mahal " .
vince has requested that i ask each of you to only use the colored printer
" taj mahal " for presentations , newsletters , etc . that require at least 90 %
of color . these cartridges are very expensive and several times we have
picked up a copy of something that only had color on the first page and it
would be maybe 15 - 20 pages long . this is not cost effective .
if you have something that has color on the first page , but not on the rest
of the presentation , then please just print the first page on the color
printer
and the rest on " bandit " or " wagon " .
your help will be greatly appreciated !
thanks !
