Subject: meeting with vince set for 1 pm monday , april 17
maureen , thank you very much for taking time away from your project to talk
with me this morning . since the management decision to close info central , i
have been doing small projects that , while necessary , do not require my
education , knowledge or research capabilities .
i appreciate your suggestion that i speak to vince since i am anxious to
return to contributing at a higher level . i am attaching my resume in the
hope that it will trigger ideas for possible ways that i can use my abilities
in the research department . i have worked as an information specialist for
14 years , doing research for people at all levels in both the pharmaceutical
and energy industries . i have focused most heavily on business research , but
learn quickly and can branch out in whatever direction necessary for a
project .
i ' m looking forward to meeting with vince on monday afternoon . thanks again
for your help .
