field 9 = i have just sent you another message . i have inspected the bill
summary for the last and current months , and it seems that my payment plan
has been changed by you without my authorization . last year i was on a flat
annual payment plan ( about $ 220 per year ) , paid in one installment . i did not
agree to switch to any other plan , unless you asked me a question regarding
the billing in a vague or deceptive way . i hope that you will look into this
matter promptly and refund any excessive charges .
