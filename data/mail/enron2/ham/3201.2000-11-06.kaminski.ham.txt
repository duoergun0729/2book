vince :
i would like to personally thank you for spending the day with us at the
mscf program at carnegie mellon . the time you spent talking to us about
enron , and the energy industry in general , was very much appreciated . in
fact , i believe some students who were not previously interested in energy
are now interested because of the things about which you spoke . i have
signed up for an interview for the associate program at enron , and i hope to
speak to you again through involvement in the associate program . thanks
again .
sincerely ,
kent garrett
