correction - i was going too fast last night ( you said cornell not carneige
mellon ) . cornell interviews are monday , october 30 & tuesday , october 31 . we
are faxing shmuel oren ' s resume to kristin and checking to see if there is
any time on the closed schedule , or if the interviewers will stay longer to
include him . i will let you know today if we can make it work .
sorry my first e - mail was incorrect .
