Subject: re : credit . com cv ' s
my feedback :
philip has an excellent cv and background - - - phd coursework at university
of chicago , and work experience at long term capital ( hopefully he learned
something ) . his views are somewhat idealistic - - - his aim is to make
bid - offers in any product , and he could not really address how he would
handle illiquidity . nevertheless , if bryan needs traders , he can fit the
role .
zak seemed somewhat unfocused . he has worked on a variety of projects , but
does not have any specific view in mind as to what he would like to do . he
seemed very academically oriented , and might be hard to communicate and work
with . i do not see him working in the trenches , and i do not see him leading
the group either . he would be a good person to brainstorm ideas with .
