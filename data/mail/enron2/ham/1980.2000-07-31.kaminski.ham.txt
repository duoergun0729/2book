Subject: reminder
hello everyone :
vince has asked me to send the following as a reminder :
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
this is another reminder about the responsibility we have as a group for
cleaning the conference rooms after meetings . for many visitors to enron
a conference room maybe the first and the last exposure to the company .
last thursday , some members of the group left , leaving behind their lunch
boxes
on the table . please , don ' t embarrass me by having to point out to you that
your mothers
don ' t work here .
vince
