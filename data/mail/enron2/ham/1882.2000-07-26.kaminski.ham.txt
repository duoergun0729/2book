marty :
absolutely yes ! we are now using option functions in the exotic options
library ( in r : \ exotica which everybody in risk management has access to )
instead of the old visual basic code in the powermod file . this improved the
calculation speed for options quite a bit .
we are also embarking on a new project to develop the next generation
structuring and pricing models . i will discuss about this project in more
detail with you soon and get your input , but the main goals i see now are :
1 . superior performance ( speed ) to enable fast pricing especially for the
underwriting group ,
2 . proper documentation for easy maintenance and ability to quickly adapt to
meet future needs , and
3 . security / access control to the files .
the first stage in this process is to take inventory of what we have : i am
documenting the current structuring models . this step is important not only
for developing our next generation models but also for the aa audit of all
the ees pricing models .
