Subject: visa status
i want to keep you informed about my visa status .
my current hlb visa expires on 15 th january , 2000 . my hlb visa extension
application has been submitted to ins by milenia soto , enron ' s immigration
attorney . i spoke with milenia soto yesterday and came to know that she has
not received the receipt yet , however , she told me that it is perfectly legal
to work based on the fact that application for extension has been submitted
to ins .
milenia soto has received the receipts from ins of my change of status
application package which includes submission of applications for change of
status , work permit , advanced parole and finger print . earlier , my i - 140
application was approved by ins during the first week of september , 1999 .
if you need additional information and / or want to contact milenia soto , her
phone number is ( 713 ) 522 0141 .
sincerely ,
