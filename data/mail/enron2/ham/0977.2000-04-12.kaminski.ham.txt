change . tom and i are reminded of this again as we announce the departure of
john echols , whose extraordinary capabilities have been instrumental to the
successful launch of ees , and to our tremendous growth in the two - and - a - half
years since then . john is continuing his career at enron .
marty sunde , currently managing director of sales joe earle , president
and ceo of enron facility services ; kevin hughes , vice president and chief

quarter and are well positioned to meet or exceed our targets this year ! in

contracting activity and we  , ve more than doubled our first quarter sales of
