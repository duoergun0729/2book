Subject: charles shen
vince : update on charles shen : he called me this morning to verify that we
had received his faxed paystub . i told him that we had , and that i had
relayed the information to you , but hadn ' t heard back from you yet . he is
definitely interested in working for enron , and ended up saying that he
didn ' t mean to be demanding and really only wanted a package a little better
than the one he has at williams .
i told him that i would follow up with you to see where you wanted to go from
here , and that i would get back to him as soon as i received some
instructions from you .
please let me know if you would like me to do anything else or find out any
more information from him .
