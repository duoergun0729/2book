subject : spring 2001 conference participation by jeffrey k . skilling
rick / vince ,
good morning .
in my 9 / 14 e - mail , i advised you of the practitioner - industry cefer ( center
for energy finance education and research ) conference we are planning for
spring 2001 . as you know , we would like to invite jeff skilling to be the
keynote speaker at the thur . evening dinner . the following day ' s four
topics consist of risk management , deregulation , real options , and
international / globalization . the majority of invitees would be
( predominantly u . s . - based ) energy - industry practitioners , as well as
several academics .
given lead time issues in these matters , we have reserved hotel rooms in
austin for feb . 22 , 2001 . could i ask you to ascertain jeff skilling ' s
availability for that evening ?
thanks ,
ehud ronn
