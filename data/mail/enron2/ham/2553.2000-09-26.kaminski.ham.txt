Subject: color copier
thanks for your immediate response .
the problem seems to be the cost .
iain , i have the smallest group but we are
willing to pay what it takes for the copier .
on the other hand there may be other groups
that are larger and may not need the copier
as much and are not willing to pay the cost .
seems to me , the copier is a necessity for the floor ,
it would save not only time , but money also
in the long haul .
we have updated every possibility on the
32 nd floor and this copier is needed for quick
presentations , meetings , etc . and allows everyone
not to depend on color printers as much !
( gives us choices )
please after today , once we get together regarding
this matter , i will let ina continue with the process ,
whereby , i can continue focusing on what is best
for my group as well as the floor .
thanks
