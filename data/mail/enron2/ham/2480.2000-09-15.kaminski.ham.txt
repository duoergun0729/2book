grant , i did talk with tanya this evening however since i ' m on vacation
friday i wanted to outline here what rabi has discussed with me .
1 ) title . . . . . he is currently at a vp level and we are offering him manager
2 ) sign on bonus . . . . . . . . . . . the 15 k is not coving the lost bonus he will
receive at he current co ( $ 25 k )
3 ) salary . . . . . . . . . . . he will receive a " risk premium " of approx 10 % befor
tax . he is not able to quantify this for us and i was not able to get a
number out of him as to what he is looking for .
he is very enthusiastic and wants to work for enron but wanted to see if we
could do anything to enhance our offer in these areas .
