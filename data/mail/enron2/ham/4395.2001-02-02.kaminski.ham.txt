1 . an overview of the modern giants research project
2 . descriptions of three broad areas of research interest ( business and
organizational design , new business creation , and capital investment
decision making ) together with the associated interview questions .
we fully understand that these interview questions are far too
encompassing , and that there ' s no way we could get through all of them in a
single , one - hour meeting . what we plan to do is " specialize " the interviews
by the background and expertise of participants . in some cases , we will
focus only on new business creation ; in others , we will focus primarily on
the allocation of capital ; in others we will focus on the basic economic
model that underlies the trading or energy services business . future visits
may focus on the remaining , unanswered questions , or on other areas of
interest of our faculty colleagues . these questions should therefore be
regarded more as a set of interests , rather than a strict protocol that we
will strive to complete from beginning to end .
hope this provides the necessary background for the trip .
