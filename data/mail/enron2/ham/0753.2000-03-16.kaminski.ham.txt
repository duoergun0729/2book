shirley ,
it ' s easier to communcate by e - mail , since i am moving from
meeting to meeting ( but i have the laptop always with me ) .
please give me a phone number that i could call tomorrow .
what is the time difference between california and your
location ? i think it ' s 2 hours ( ca - > tx ) - is that right ?
i can do the conference call any time from 9 - 11 ca time .
would that be ok on your side ?
thanks ,
nick
