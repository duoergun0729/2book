kevin ,
please , talk to jeff shankman ' s secretary about including all the research
group members on
the 31 st floor in the company provided lunches ( when they are available ) .
if an additional lunch is needed from time to time , it ' s fine , but it should
be seen as a something done
under exceptional circumstances .
