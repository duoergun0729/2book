subject : allocation schedule
we spoke prior to the holiday and you were working on a list on support names
and projects that research is working on for various bus . can you tell me
how you are doing on that ? sarah brown , my manager , had a meeting with corp
and they are disputing the billing we are proposing to bill to them ( $ 1 . 9 m ) .
their argument is that they are going to bill ena back anyway ; therefore ,
they have agreed to take 40 % of the amount we intented to bill them in 2001 ,
which is approximately $ 760 k . if you have any questions , please call . thanx .
