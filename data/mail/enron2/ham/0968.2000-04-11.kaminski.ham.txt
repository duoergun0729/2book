i think full time employment starting in about six months seems to be the
best option . it is probably best to get my dissertation wrapped up before
taking on additional commitments .

zeigham ,
we discussed two options ( not necessarily mutually exclusive ) :
1 . summer internship
2 . full employment .
are you interested exclusively in full employment ?
i need the answer asap , as we are going to discuss the additional summer
intern positions this afternoon .

subject : hi
vince :
it was very nice talking to you at the texas finance festival and i think
the telecom market that enron is entering is very interesting and very
lucrative . i would be very interested in working in that segment for
enron .
however , i talked to sheridan about this oppurtunity and he said that it
is probably going to be another six months before i finish my
dissertation . so while i am definitely interested , the start date will
probably have to be around that time .
at any rate , it was a pleasure meeting you again and hopefully once i have
defended my dissertation we can discuss employment oppurtunities in
greater detail .
