vince ,
attached is my latest attempt to wrap everything together . our timetable
is very short as we need an " approved by enron " version of the paper to don
by next wednesday . don has already made editorial changes for us and may
make some additional " writing style " changes but he doesn ' t change the
content .
i ' ll give you a call later today to alert you to the e - mail .
take care ,
john
p . s . i had a nice conversation with steve . sounds like he ' s landed a
pretty good contract with wiley .
