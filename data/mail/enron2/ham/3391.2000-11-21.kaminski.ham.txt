Subject: in confidence : prc summary
hi vince
following our prc meeting yesterday , here are the high - level facts as i
presented them :
ben parsons , overall : satisfactory . good interpersonal skills , we have
questions on his quant abilities . reluctant to discuss / share his modelling
work , and that which i have seen has too many hand fixes to give me
confidence in his rigour . other enroncredit . com feedback indicates that he
is sometimes prepared to compromise quant analysis to keep the traders happy .
matthew williams , overall : excellent . superior quant skills , excellent
everywhere else . recommended for promotion to senior specialist .
kirstee hewitt , overall : excellent . a solid all - round performance , and a
huge workload . in recognition of the level of responsibility kirstee is
bearing i ' m recommending her for promotion to senior specialist .
sharad agnihotri , overall : excellent . superior quant skills , excellent
everywhere else . very self - directed and commercial - minded . already
operating at manager level in my opinion . flagged for promotion next
mid - year if performance continues at this level .
slava danilov , overall : excellent . superior quant skills , excellent
everywhere else . as a non - commercial - type quant he is hard to fault , but
will probably never work on a trading desk . already operating at manager
level in terms of his depth and rigour of analysis , and the extent to which
he is contributing to the team . flagged for promotion next mid - year if
performance continues at this level .
