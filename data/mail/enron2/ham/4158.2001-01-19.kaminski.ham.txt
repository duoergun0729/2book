Subject: transition to research group - an update
vince ,
just wanted to let you know that i had a meeting with wade cline ( coo , enron
india ) , neil mcgregor ( president , dpc ) , and mohan gurunath ( cfo , dpc ) today .
though i had already spoken to all of them earlier about my joining your
group , today it became official , and all of them supported the move . i
explained to them what we would be doing , and the results expected from the
henwood study .
dpc would like to pay the costs for the study , and that was mentioned . there
maybe some tax issues etc . that need to be cleared , and other related issues
that i would like to discuss with you , so i will leave them till i get to
houston .
i also spoke about anshuman , and there was resistance to his leaing for such
a long time . however , i have agreement from folks here to send him to
houston for a shorter stint on dpc budget . i will try to finalize that
before i leave . i will call you in the evening to just chat .
i am very thankful to you for giving the opportunity you have . things here
have deteriorated dramatically over the last few weeks . morale is quite down
due to many lay - offs .
i am really looking forward to returning to houston , and the family ! !
regards ,
sandeep .
