Subject: marketing for your espeak session
vince :
thanks for your time earlier this week ; i ' m looking forward to your espeak
event .
sarah and i met with our etv contact yesterday , and we will be able to put a
bulleted list on the elevator screens to advertise your espeak . please let
me know what you would like us to post for you , and we will do the rest !
we also have plans to market specifically to the trader community here at
enron , so you should get a high participation rate , especially from those
groups .
thanks , again .
