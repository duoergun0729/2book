hey you guys ,
we are trying to implement a ' var transaction ' policy - and would like your
opinion .
this is going to be tough - because i ' m not sure we have implemented a
similiar policy across any of our other ' books ' - that is - we looking to
bring in all the accrual / operational assets as well as the mtm stuff
( lambdas ) . to have a real - live ' configuration ' of the system .
if assets / routes / servers etc . . . are added - what is the impact on the ' value '
of the system and what it ' s worth .
john has attached a draft below - for your review and thoughts .
i can see how this works in a trading environment - when you actually know
the var of your whole trading portfolio . however - i ' ve not seen this done
with a mixture of mtm & accrual assets . add the spice of a ' operational
system ' valuation - and this will be tough to quantify and model .
step 1 - configure system and value it
step 2 - calculate a var on this . we will need to do some work here !
step 3 - calculate the incremental var of new deals / amendements / reconfigs etc
- tough . . . .
see what you think ?

here is a first rough draft of a " value @ risk " transaction policy .
i would like you to start looking at where we are going on the policy and get
some early thinking going on limits for the v @ r . for example , should we
effectively shut down all server relocations without approval , or allow some
level of mb of storage to be moved around or reconfigured ?
i need some commercial and industry realism for this . we may need rick
paiste or your industry helpers ( marquardt , etc . to help us ) .
barry , lou , i need your input .
