Subject: clayton vernon
kevin ,
vasant and i talked to clayton about his request for transfer . clayton
received a conditional approval contingent
upon completion of the current project he works on . vasant will formulate
exact definition of the deliverables
and we will hold clayton to it . if he fails to deliver the request for
transfer will be rejected . anything else
would be highly demoralizing to everybody .
clayton has so far produced exactly zero ( no single output was delivered )
though he was advertising
the projects inside and outside the group as completed . i want you to be
aware of it , because i have
serious doubts regarding clayton ' s integrity .
