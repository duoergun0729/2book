hi ,
i have tested both cplex and xpress - mp optimization software in solving our
network design problem .
xpress is more user friendly hence it takes less developing time . however ,
cplex performs significantly better
in term of computation time , especially in integer programming .
as a result , eventhougth xpress is easier to use and cheaper , i would
recommend our ebs group to use cplex .
please let me know what do you think . . .
the test problem has 10 nodes , 77 cables , 5 cable speed .
the table below represents the computation time in seconds for solving this
problem .
the second column indicates if the general integer variables are relaxed ( but
still keep the binary variables ) .
the " lp " column represents the computational time when solving relaxed
problem ( no binary & integer variable constraints ) .
xpress took too much time in solving case 4 and 6 so i had to stop the
process and report the best solutions it found .
below are the graph .
