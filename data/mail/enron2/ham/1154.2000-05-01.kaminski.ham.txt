vince ,
how are you ? hope all is well .
is there any chance we can schedule my visit to enron on friday , may 19 ,
or friday , may 26 ?
by the end of april i was able to attract a top new student to work on the
project .
the other one for the coming year will be giuseppe . by spending the summer
at enron , he will be in a position to bring the new one up to speed and
create an intellectual team here at stanford to look at these problems .
i must move ahead soon to put the project in place and get the work going .
talk to you soon ,
nick
