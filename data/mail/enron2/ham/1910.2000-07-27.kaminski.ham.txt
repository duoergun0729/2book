i actually called stan horton ' s office yesterday to find out if they knew
anything about the aga membership , and cindy stark who works with stan
informed me that stan cancelled our associate membership with aga effective
january , 2000 . i called jay copan with aga back and left him a voicemail
with the information . i asked him to call me if he had any questions and i
have not heard back from him . i ' ll considered it closed unless i hear back
from him .
