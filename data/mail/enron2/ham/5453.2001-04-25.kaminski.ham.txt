if the schedule works , perhaps a carpool is best for attending the course , given the number of us going . vasant has offered to drive . dependiing on driving speed and traffic , leaving houston by 9 : 30 am should give sufficient time to make the lpm class , including some time for lunch .
please let me know if you are interested in the carpool or have alternate plans or suggestions .
thanks ,
martin
