Subject: research group accountant
hi dawn :
the research group has moved around so much that we do not know
who to contact for accounting issues . we need to reverse some money
back to one of the groups we are supporting , but do not know who to contact .
do you have a clue ?
we are also still using an sap corp . co # and rc # because we do not
know where to go to get the new ena # ' s .
if you could help in this we would really appreciate it .
thanks !
