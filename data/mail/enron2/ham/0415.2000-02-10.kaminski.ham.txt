Subject: re : aiesec
dear mr . kaminski ,
we will be glad to have you with us this saturday for the mock sales day .
this event is part of our recruitment process . so far this semester the
recruitment has been very successful - we have 16 new members , compared to 10
experienced ones .
the next goal is to keep these people interested in what we do and build the
aieseec spirit in them . i hope that this saturday will greatly contribute to
that .
here is the schedule so far :
9 : 00 - 10 : 00 breakfast
10 : 00 - 12 : 00 sales training session
12 : 00 - 1 : 00 lunch break ( board of advisors and alumni coming )
1 : 00 - 3 : 30 practice sales calls
some details :
i don ' t have the training program finalized yet , but i ' m sure it will be
good . i have a teacher from uh program for excellence in selling and the
local committee president , tim , organizing it . it should be interactive and
motivating : ) . if you are interested you are more than welcome to come in
the morning and have fun with us .
i ' m inviting the board of advisors members and some alumni to join us at
noon . lunch will be provided . our members are cooking ! and it is a very
international crowd ! so far we have german meatballs , some venesuelan soup
( don ' t remember the name , but it ' s supposed to be very good and a lot of it ) ,
spanish tortilla de patata and other international dishes .
the part when you would help is the practise sales calls . this is a way to
provide experience to our new members , we are inviting our board of advisors ,
alumni and everyone who is interested in aiesec to play as company
representatives . i will give you case scenarios , everyone will have an office
and the new members will have to " sell " aiesec to you . one of the goals of
the organization is to create as many exchange opportunities as possible , so
the new members will try to get you to sign a contract for taking an
international intern into your imaginary company .
i hope you find it interesting : ) .
directions to uh , college of business :
take i - 45 south , exit spur 5 , at the street light at the end of the freeway
take a right , at calhoun street light take a right again , the college of
business will be on your left hand side . park in the parking lot in front
( you don ' t need a permit on the weekends ) .
please , let me know if you are coming and what time and i will make sure
someone will meet you at the entrance of the building .
thank you for your time ,
biliana
