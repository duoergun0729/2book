during our off - site at columbia lakes recently , we identified areas in ena
where significant gaps exist that need filling at the analyst and associate
level . we have scheduled an off - cycle super saturday on june 3 , 2000 and i
would like your participation as an interviewer . we will need approximately
25 - 30 interviewers to fill approximately 30 associate & analyst positions . i
am counting on everyone making themselves available on the third to
facilitate this priority action item .
