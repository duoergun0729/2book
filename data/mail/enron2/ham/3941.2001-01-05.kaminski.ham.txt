richard et al
under the new electricity trading arrangments ( neta ) in the uk and looking
forward i think it will be increasingly important in modelling market
behaviour and transmission related costs to have some form of system model
incorporating opf and atc .
therefore , in principle i am happy to support option 3 and to pay a 1 / 3 share
of the cost . however , before i commit to this particular package , i would
like to be comfortable that the generic powerworld software could be suitably
customised to capture the special features of neta .
i understand marco verreschi who initiated interest from our end is pursuing
this with martin lin ( research , houston ) . however , due to commitments next
week , and my desire to see powerworld in action etc it is likely to be the
following week before he and i can say " lets do it " .

gentlemen ,
i recommend that we purchase this package and split the cost 3 ways between 3
power trading desks .
i think that we should go for option 3 ( ~ $ 15 , 000 ) .
lance cunningham in my group looked at this software package and found it
very useful for modeling transmission problems .
please , feel free to ask him for technical details in support of this
recommendation .
vince

vince ,
we have three options to increase our availability across enron for the power
world load flow software .
option 1 , upgrade to a site license for the load flow software only . price
$ 9 , 990 . 00
this would give all of enron the ability to perform load flows , but not
determine marginal cost or available transfer capacity ( atc ) because only the
optimal power flow ( opf ) version can perform that task .
option 2 , site license for the load flow and purchase 1 opf package for
walter coffer ' s group . price $ 11 , 240 .
this would give all of enron the ability to perform load flows and one other
group the ability to determine marginal cost and atc .
option 3 , site license for load flows , opf and atc . price $ 14 , 990 . 00
this would give all of enron the ability to perform load flows , marginal
cost , and atc .
regards ,
lance
