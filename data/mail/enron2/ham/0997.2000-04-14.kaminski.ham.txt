Subject: monday ' s newsletter
hello vince !
i ' m working with michael sergeev to produce this next issue of the
newsletter . do you have a suggestion for the kaminski column on page one ?
if so , please tell me what you ' d like to use and i ' ll get it ready either
today or monday morning .
at some point , when you have a couple of minutes , we should sit down and talk
about your philosophy regarding the newsletter and what you would like to see
in the future . i ' d like to get a little creative with it once i know your
thoughts on this .
best regards ,
sam
p . s . - note that i am " william smith " in the lotus notes system . there is
also a " will smith " that works in it . we forward each other ' s mail all the
time ! : - )
