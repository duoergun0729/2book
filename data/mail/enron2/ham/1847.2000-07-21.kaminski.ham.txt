Subject: tropical cyclones
dear all ,
yesterday , i mentioned to vince the inhouse modelling capabilities and the
impact weather and the weather forecast can have on some of enron ' s
operations and risk management positions . for this reason i have attached
three files , two of those show to tropical cyclones off the coasts of
australia , i . e . rachel and drena . tropical cyclones pose a significant risk ,
and an early warning system can be part of a better risk strategy .
please , note that the modelling system has been further improved since the
simulation was done .
also , we can focus on another large problem and associated risk . dust storms
can pose a significant risk to a number of industries , and the prediction
of such events has been very difficult , if not impossible . for this reason a
gis database has been developed and coupled to the nwp model , which
allows prediction of such events in realtime . for the depicted event an
estimated 6 million tonnes of top soil was lost , and with it $ $ .
maybe we can set up a conference call to discuss
* the above mentioned points
* further improvments in forecasting based on the high resolution forecasts
* weather and climate on a global perspective for enron
* how to further improve the forecast for enron
regards ,
christian
ps : i tried to sent of this e - mail last night , but their appears to be a
limit of 10 mb , so i will send off the individual files . . . .
