hi mike ,
thanks for the message .
here is one more reason why we should have our own in - house modelling :
the pcmdi nwp weather maps have been discontinued
the pcmdi wxmap web has been discontinued starting 20 december , 2000
please see the u . s . navy wxmaps at . . .
i will shortly forward a set of minimum requirements ( hardware . . . ) , softare
has been written by me , with some public domain software .
i am thinking of setting up an internal website with model output data , and
verification info .
cheers ,

new plan :
let ' s plan on your coming to houston march 12 th - april 2 nd ( after our
summer / winters respectively
but . .
let ' s proceed with the project without pause :
1 . please send up the software that needs to be installed along with
operating system requirements
2 . please copy me on forecasting provided to sydney office on a daily basis
if we work on these two fronts , it will optimize your time here and permit
transotion to cover your forecasting there
