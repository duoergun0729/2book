subject : presentation on metals
hi maureen ,
it was good to meet you last week and hear your presentation on the metals -
full of advice on what to think about and all the various things that affect
the market place . i am only sorry i had to dash off to the airport - good
job i left when i did though as check - in took ages !
anyway , please could you send me through a copy of that presentation either
on email or if it is located on the network somewhere then i could access it
over the intranet ? i will be joining the lme conference tomorrow so am
currently trying to do a bit of reading in preparation .
thanks very much in advance & look forward to seeing the presentation over
here in london .
kind regards
alison
