Subject: re : visit to enron by professor nalin kulatilaka of boston
university
hi iris :
may 17 th is fine . he will probably need to come in the night before ( the 16 th )
and he can make a hotel reservation at the doubletree or the hyatt and tell
them he is a guest of enron and he will get a corporate rate . we will reimburse
him for room expense only . he will need to pick up any miscellaneous room
charges . we will also reimburse him for his flight expense and cab fare .
the doubletree telephone # is : 713 - 759 - 0202 and the hyatt telephone is :
713 - 654 - 1234 .
he can either leave his receipts with me when he is here or mail them
to me and i will have a check cut . i will need his ss # .
if you have any more questions , please let me know .
thanks !
