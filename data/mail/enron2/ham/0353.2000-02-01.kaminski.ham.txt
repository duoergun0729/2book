hi jodi ,
i have been remiss in keeping up with you and letting you know what is
going on
in my little world here at kellogg .
in other matters , life at kellogg has me very busy at the moment . i am taking
a full load , including fin decisions and am helping prof . petersen write a new
class called advanced valuation , which will be offered in the spring . a big
part of the focus of this class is going to be on real options , which is cool
stuff . and as poor as my timing is , i would like to ask you a
question / favor .
for purposes of this class , do you think it would be possible to obtain
some of
enron ' s thoughts on real options ? i was thinking , for example , that a
fuel - switching analysis would be neat to included in the case packet . of
course , none of the numbers or names need be real - - only the concepts . well ,
let me know what you think of that - - who knows , enron might actually like the
free exposure .
all the best ,
chris
