however if you arrive too early you may be requested to perform some ranch
chores .
please feel free to bring a spouse or friend if you choose . if you could
rsvp by jan 23 rd that would be great .
directions to my house are as follows :
take i 45 north past the woodlands towards conroe
take exit 83 crighton road exit
stay on feeder road through stop sign until you get to traffic light
( crighton road )
turn right onto crighton road cross railroad tracks
go to 3 rd street , about 1
miles , and turn right , which is the only way you
can turn . this is kidd road ; however most of the time the street sign is
knocked down .
