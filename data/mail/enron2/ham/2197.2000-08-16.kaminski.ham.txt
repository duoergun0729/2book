julie :
unfortunately , our reviewer has not come back to us with comments , so i am
sending you the final version without the benefit of review .
the attached zipped file contains the second half of the chapter for which i
was responsible . vince will send you his half separately . putting them
together should be a simple matter of cut and paste , assuming that vince has
not changed his equation , figure , or table numbering .
i presume chris will be reading through the chapter once again for editorial
reasons . there is one place where i would ask him for specific redaction :
table 3 . 6 " model specifications " on page 14 / 15 has a column labeled " equation
reference " . some cells are blank because the equations specified have not
been referenced previously in the parts i have written . nevertheless , the
concepts are surely introduced elsewhere in the book , and it may be helpful
for chris to insert the appropriate reference in this table . alternatively ,
one could simply delete the column .
if i can help in any way , please do not hesitate to contact me .
