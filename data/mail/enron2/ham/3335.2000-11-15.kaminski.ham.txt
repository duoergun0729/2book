dear dr . kaminski ,
how are you ? i seemed to have lost contact with you . the last contact
was with a ms . graham - regarding my coming to houston for an interview -
while i was still living in london .
i am now back in the states - where i spent the last few months working
for a dot . com . although this internet opportunity was interesting , it was
not a viable one . i guess part of the technology firm shake out .
therefore i am now interviewing again - with investment banks and
insurance companies . is enron still interested in having me come down for
an interview ? if so , please let me know how to proceed .
thank you in advance for your time and consideration .
kind regards ,
iris mack
