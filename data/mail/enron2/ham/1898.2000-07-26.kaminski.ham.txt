subject : john sherriff ' s copper position
hi esther ,
i just talked to john sherriff about his " enron " copper position . i suspect
that this is not currently being captured within the mg mercur position
database - he would like to have that included in the var spreadsheet and
shown as a separate line . do you have any information regarding this deal
( i . e . position sizes , qualities etc . ) or be able to direct me to someone who
may be able to assist in getting this information ?
thanks ,
anjam
