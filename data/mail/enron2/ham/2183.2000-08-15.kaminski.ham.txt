vince ,
thank you so much for forwarding this information to me as well as making
some initial contacts on campus ! i was wondering if you could provide a two
hour time slot in the next two weeks for the cal berkeley planning session
with the entire campus team here in the office ? i would like to get the
entire team together prior to the career fair on the 8 th so that we can go
over the strategy , dates on campus , and roles / responsibilities .
also , i know that you mentioned that the first couple of weeks in october
would be the best to target for the general information session . how does
the week of october 9 th look for you ? is there a certain day that works the
best ? i would like to work with your schedule to see if we can come up with
a date in that timeframe .
thanks again for your help !
