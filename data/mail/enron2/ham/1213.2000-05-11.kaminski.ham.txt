Subject: re : summer visits
steve ,
i can pick up the cost of your trip from the research group budget .
the more i think about it , the more i am convinced it would be difficult
to justify 2 trips per person . i think that we should go for one contiguous
stay per person and make a good
effort to make these trips productive .

thanks for offering to look my presentation over . the deadline for
submission has been extended until tomorrow ( friday ) , so there ' s less of a
hurry .
as regard our summer visits , we ' ll need to speak to dale over the budget .
personal commitments mean it ' s difficult for me to take two whole months to
visit , so if the cost is prohibitive i may need to make just one shorter
visit . i ' d obviously like to spend longer , and two visits seems to be the
only way i can do it . i believe the situation is similar for kirstee .
i ' ve persuaded richard to pay for matt ' s visit in its entirety , and i ' ve no
doubt that rac / credit trading will pick up the bills for ben and kirstee .
it ' s difficult to think who ' d be the natural group to pay for me . i honestly
think i ' ll have difficulty persuading , e . g . richard , that it ' s worth his
while to pay for my visit . i get the impression he thinks i ' m doing ok
without the need to go to houston for further training .
i ' m interviewing a candidate for bjorn ' s model review role during today ' s
videoconference , so we ' ll need to speak beforehand or perhaps friday .
all the best ,
steve
