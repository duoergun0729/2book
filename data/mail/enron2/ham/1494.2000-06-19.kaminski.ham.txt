janelle ,
fms records show that ext . 39189 was installed on 6 / 1 for mr . paleologo ,
there is no record to indicate the phone was ever puded .
i have requested to kathy brooks to re - install the phone . kathy says that
she will reseach to find out why the phone was picked up and she will let me
know .
thanks
