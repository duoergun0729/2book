Subject: new employee
shirley :
don ' t panic , but we have a new employee , chonawee supatgiat , who is starting
on feb . 8 th ( yes , today ) . sorry about the short notice , but he just
accepted on the 7 th at 5 p . m . he will be primarily supporting ebs ( enron
broadband services ) and reporting to ravi , but we will need to find a spot
for him on the 19 th floor . he can even use my office temporarily if needed
since i have a desk on 44 as well .
i ' ll talk to you about the specifics in the morning .
thanks ,
