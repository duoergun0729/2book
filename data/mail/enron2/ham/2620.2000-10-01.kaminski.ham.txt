title : current challenges in modeling power price volatility
author : dr . vince kaminski , head of quantitative research , enron capital &

abstract :
the power market developments in the us have created several unique
challenges for energy industry economists . we discuss the major factors

the exceptionally high volatility of electricity prices . we feel that some of
them may be a necessary price to pay for increased market efficiency and
expanded customer choice .
