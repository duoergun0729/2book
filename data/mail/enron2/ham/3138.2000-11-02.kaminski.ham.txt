gentlemen ,
thank you for the opportunity to learn about a new communication position
within your group . ? ? based on our discussions , here are some initial
thoughts / observations on the job and the task .
?
* daily email newsletter for primarily two audiences :
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 . ? internal for employees available via the enron
intranet
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 2 . ? external for clients , industry at large
?
* also suggest the newsletter be sent to a targeted group of trade press . ? as
this information tool builds momentum and credibility , it will support the
leadership positioning of ? enron ' s trading group . ? ? plus , it could become a
driver for media inquiries and ? requests for further information or
interviews with enron ? trading experts .
?
* i heard you wanting internal and external versions for both morning and
afternoon distribution . ? ? that is an aggressive set of daily mailings . i
would want to review the scope of the content and look at the frequency . ?
just like print publications , ? email newsletters are ? now the rage and too
many are ? landing in the email inboxes . ? ? my counsel would be to start with a
manageable number and do it well . ? you can always increase frequency . ?
difficult to cut back on frequency without it appearing as a take away or
lack of commitment to the product . staffing ? ?
?
* invite outside industry analysts or clients to provide commentary .
?
* consider developing an " editorial advisory board " to govern the
content . ? ? traders , ? legal department , communications dept . a
multidisciplinary group that ? can add value to the publication .
?
* suggest finding an ims or it resource from within enron to be assigned to
this communications effort . ? ? database set up for the email addresses ,
technical issues arise ? for ? creating the links etc . ? managing an
e - newsletter in my current position , i can ? tell you that a writer / editor has
enough to do to compile content . ? ? you want mailings to go off without any
glitches . ? or if there are glitches , he or she can ? solve quickly . ? what are
the implications of these mailings on the company ' s computer systems ? ?
?
* budget . ? although not a typical print publication , this effort should have
a budget . ? graphics , freelance or contract writing , photography ? any special
software or hardware needs associated with this effort ? ?
?
* review process . ? what is the review process for ? this publication . ? legal
guidelines ? ? corporate guidelines with regards to style , graphics
etc . ? ? technical review of the material for accuracy ? ? a clear policy should
be established ? up front for the review process so everyone involved knows
and understands their role and responsibilities ? towards this communication
effort .
?
* have you surveyed what is out in the marketplace ? ? ? gather samples
of ? newsletters that you like or don ' t like for discussion purposes .
?
* measurement / evaluation of the newsletter . ? ? how ? will the effectiveness of
the newsletter be measured ? ? hits on the website . ? inquiries from clients ? ?
don ' t have a quick answer but ? some goals should be set to measure against .
?
* maintenace of the mailing lists should reside with the individual groups
participating in the newsletter . ? ? maintenance of the newsletter databases
should not be the responsibility of the communications representative . ? ? ?
?
this sent to you in the spirit of exploring the position further . ? look
forward to your feedback . ? ? thank you for your consideration . ?
?
sincerely ,
susan v . gonzalez
