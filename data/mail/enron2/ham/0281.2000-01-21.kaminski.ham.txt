timothy :
i still have a problem . when i am on the eci network i cannot receive
email , and , even worse , i cannot even send email . this is not an
acceptable situation . i need to have a fully functional email account on
the eci side as well as the ena side . don ' t tell me that its against
policy because i know that ravi thuraisingham has already be set up this way
for months . i don ' t care if mail from one network is forwarded to the
other as i will have access in houston to both , but i can already see that i
need to have functional accounts on both sides , or it will be a continual
thorn in my side when travelling to portland , etc . . .
again thanks for your help on getting this set up correctly ,

subject : eci id
i must have written down your phone number incorrectly , it did not work .
regarding my user id on the eci network , i would be set up in the same way
as ravi thuraisingham with an id on both the ena and the eci networks . i am
in the corp . research group but am spending about 80 % of my time in support
of eci in the trading and origination areas .
feel free to contact me if you need any further info .
