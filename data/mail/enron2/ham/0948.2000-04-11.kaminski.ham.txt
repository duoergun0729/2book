stinson , i feel i would benefit from understanding the monte carlo techniques
and what it applies to , as well as when it is used these mc techniques . i think
i could get several people interested . thanks , hal

hal ,
actually , i am no longer scheduled to speak at the risk conference on m - c
techniques . we could probably put together an internal training for you if
you want . i ' ll bring this up with vince at our staff meeting tomorrow .
it would be helpful if you can describe for me the intended audience and the
types of applications that would interest them .
thanks ,
