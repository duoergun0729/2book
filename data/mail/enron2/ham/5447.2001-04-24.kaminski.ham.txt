subject : dr . michelle foss - energy institute
dear mr . kaminski ,
i am writing to ask a favor for dr . michelle foss . as you know we will
be running our " new era " program from may 14 - may 25 th . dr . foss was
wondering if on may 22 nd ( between 1 : 30 pm and 4 : 00 pm ) , we would be able to
bring
our participants for a tour of your trading floor . at this time we will have
30 - 40 people , and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a
trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our
participants . at this time , we have a floor from coral energy , and are
working with duke ,
and i will be contacting mr . paul roberts to arrange for the reliant energy
trading floor . i was hoping very much that you would be able to direct
me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour . will this be a
possiblity ? i really appreciate your help very much . thank you !
best regards ,
aisha jamal
