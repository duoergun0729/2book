mark !
please review the attached article and forward your comments / authorization
for its use to john martin at baylor , copying me and vince .
john and vince ,
i have a few simple comments :
1 . please use " enron corp . " [ rather than " enron corporation " ]
2 . page 3 : as of yesterday , fortune magazine named enron " most innovative "
for the sixth year in a row
3 . page 5 : 2 nd paragraph : regarding the " gas bank " concept - - i believe when
jeff first introduced it , it fell flat . i think john pick ' s that up ( and
enron ' s subsequent recovery of a version of the concept on p . 6 ) , but it ' s
probably accurate to mention that at first , it didn ' t go over .
4 . page 13 : re : cindy olson ' s comment on a possible 5 x difference between
a " satisfactory " and " superior " vp - - the difference referred to is probably
the " bonus " rather than " compensation " ( which , to me , is generally means
base salary ) ; also , it varies for each review period , as comparative
performance might vary ; further , we might want to run that quote by cindy
just to make sure she ' s ok with it ' s publication ( she might have no problem
with it whatsoever , but i know for other articles , she ' s been more reluctant
to provide that kind of statistic ) .
5 . page 17 ( after annual report quote ) : i suggest changing " enron ' s
wholesale business . . . provides " to " . . . businesses . . provide " ; also , rather
than " enron wholesale " we might want to define this by the term enron uses :
" enron wholesale services "
6 . page 18 : 2 nd paragraph : the tense switching from past to present is
technically correct if read carefully , but seems awkward when reading it
7 . page 19 : effective february , jeff skilling is " ceo " .
. . . that ' s my 2 - cents worth ! ! i think the article is great . . . even
interesting ( ha ! ) . . . even to non - mba ' s like me ! !
thanks !

vince ,
attached is my latest attempt to wrap everything together . our timetable
is very short as we need an " approved by enron " version of the paper to don
by next wednesday . don has already made editorial changes for us and may
make some additional " writing style " changes but he doesn ' t change the
content .
i ' ll give you a call later today to alert you to the e - mail .
take care ,
john
p . s . i had a nice conversation with steve . sounds like he ' s landed a
pretty good contract with wiley .
