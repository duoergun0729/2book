dear vince ,
i just wanted to thank you for inviting me to visit enron last friday and
for the generous amount of time you spent with me personally while i was
there . i found our discussions both informative and stimulating .
vince , i was genuinely impressed by the caliber of the group you have
assembled at enron . their individual and collective expertise is obvious ;
and they were most generous in exchanging ideas and sharing opinions with me .
if you or any of your people have , over the weekend , developed further
questions or thought of additional information that might be helpful , i ' m
standing by . i ' m eager to continue our dialogue .
sincerely ,
larry thorne
