jeff ,
we are reviewing the p + spread option book . one item of note is that the
correlations used to book the spread options have dropped significantly from
what was being used a year ago ( see charts below ) . i also remember that
john mee was using even higher correlations when he ran this book . in fact
he wanted to book options with a correlation of 1 . 0 , but our model would not
allow it , so he was using 0 . 999 .
we are currently calculating historical correlations for you as well . if
you want , vince and i can review this with you at the end of the day . just
let me know what time would be convenient .
