subject : re : interview with enron corp .
dear ms . crenshaw :
i recently accepted a quant position with texaco in houston . lara berry
from enron contacted me just after that , and i told her of the situation .
i agreed to send her my resume ( which i did ) and keep in touch .
enron is a fabulous corporation with exciting opportunities . mr . kaminski
is very well known in the energy field , and i have read some of his
material . i am extremely pleased that you all would be interested in me ;
however , i have given my word to texaco .
the texaco position offers a lot of opportunity and risk . this is the kind
of challenge for which i am looking . if things do not work out , however , i
would definitely contact enron again and cherish any opportunity for an
interview .
thank you very much ,
cliff parsons
