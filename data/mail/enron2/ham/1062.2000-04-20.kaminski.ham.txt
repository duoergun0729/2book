Subject: masayuki fujita from the mitsubishi research institute
i have been at enron for eight months and work under sally beck .
in december i attended the exotic energy derivatives conference , where i met
masayuki fujita from the mitsubishi research institute . he is doing research
on the deregulation of the japanese power market . we had lunch together and
chatted for some time about his work ( i worked in a japanese company for 8
1 / 2 years and speak fluent japanese , so we got along easily ) .
he was in houston this week and came by to visit . on monday , we met with
vince kaminski and grant masson and later had dinner with them . sally
suggested that i introduce him to alan aronowitz and you . of course , you
were out of town , but we did meet with alan who said you would probably want
to meet him back in tokyo anyway .
would you like for me to set something up ?
regards ,
eugenio
