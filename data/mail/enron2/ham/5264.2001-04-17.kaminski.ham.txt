hi shirley ,
thanks for corresponding with carol during my absence , and confirming our
meeting with vince kaminski at 1 : 30 on may 4 th . i have a question about
the logistics . i believe dr . kaminski has received an invitation to an
event in houston : new stanford president john hennessy is visiting a number
of cities on a " welcome tour , " and it just so happens he is hosting a
luncheon in houston on may 4 th . if dr . kaminski wants to attend the
hennessy welcome tour luncheon , donna lawrence and i could meet with him at
1 : 30 somewhere in the hotel . if he ' s not attending the presidential event ,
please let me know where you are located , and we ' ll plan travel time
accordingly .
regards ,
susan
