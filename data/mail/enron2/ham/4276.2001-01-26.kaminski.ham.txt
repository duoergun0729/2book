Subject: re : calpx prices
jason ,
i think what you may be asking for are caliso power prices . the calpx is a
scheduling coordinator and they submit balanced schedules and bid curves to
the caliso . the iso combines the curves from participating scs ( of which i
believe enron is one ) and calculates the uncongested and congested prices .
the caliso prices are available from rdi powerdat , the enron lim database , and
a number of other sources . recent historical prices are available from the
caliso web site .
i am copying your mail to tim hiezenrader , who runs the westdesk fundamentals
group . i believe he would know how you might be able to access the more
real - time caliso data that enron collects .
tim , can you help jason out ? he is a manager in the ena research group .
thanks ,
michael
