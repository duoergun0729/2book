vince ,
maureen had mentioned to me a while back that our group had approval to hire
an junior / full economist . she then asked me to contact johns hopkins sais to
get resumes of possible candidates . i have completed all this . but , before
i begin contacting these potential candidates , i wanted to confirm with you
that we have the approval to hire another person at the either junior or
associate economist level .
thank you .
