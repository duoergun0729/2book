Subject: australian energy 2000
dear vince ,
i hope you are well and that things round at enron aren ' t too hectic . it is
my pleasure to invite you to speak at energy any help would be gratefully received .
this event will be thoroughly marketed through both energy & power risk
management magazine and our extensive database . it is my aim to attract the
leading market players by providing a first - class programme with top - rated
speakers , making this a highly worthwhile event for the energy industry .
i have attached a copy of the programme for your information .
unfortunately my schedule for this event is very tight . please let me know
if you would like to participate by reurn email as it is unlikely that we
can speak on the phone as i am currently based in hong kong . if you would
like to send a colleague , then i would be happy to discuss this but it
would be great if you could complete the eprm grand slam by addressing our
three major annual events on three different continents !
i look forward to hearing from you soon .
yours sincerely ,
joel hanley
