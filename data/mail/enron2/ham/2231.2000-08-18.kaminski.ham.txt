wicke ,
thanks for a prompt reply . i am not planning any particular trip to houston
yet . for the time being , i am about to leave for london , and then poland . i
will most likely be at the olympics in sydney in late september , and in ny
in early october . mid - october could be the first realistic opportunity to
visit with enron , although i am looking forward to seeing you sooner in palo
alto . i am simply curious whether and how we could leverage together core
competencies and connectivity that both our companies seem to have or are
developing .
i am senior vice president for visa usa , responsible for strategy and
planning . i would probably bring with me ( though i haven ' t discuss it yet )
people in charge of our network or / and our coo .
best ,
andrzej
