subject : a friend of mine
vince ,
last week i was contacted by one of my friends who is very interested in becoming an enron employee . he has a phd and several years research and lab experience .
richard is afraid that being a phd is a dying breed and may need to go back to school to obtain an mba . i was wondering if you would mind looking at the attached resume to assess if you have any interest in richard , or if you feel i should encourage him to go back to school . i am unclear as to the qualifications for your group so i apologize if this request is way off base .
thank you for your help ,
kristin gandy
