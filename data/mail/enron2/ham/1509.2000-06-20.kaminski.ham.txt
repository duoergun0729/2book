Subject: sabbatical
dr . kaminski :
?
i had intended to contact you regarding a position at enron this summer , but
the department really needed me to teach a section of undergraduate
corporate finance this summer . ? if all goes well , and ? there is a place for
me at enron , i would be able to start after the summer session ends in
late ? july . ?
?
i ? discussed the possibility of a sabbatical at enron with drs . tom arnold
and alex butler , both of whom send their regards , and they both felt the
experience would be invaluable given my research and career objectives . ? dr .
arnold and i agreed that a sabbatical of 1 - 2 years would be optimal . ? i feel
that it would be difficult to get a good idea of where the company is
headed , and to show how i can be a valuable team member in helping it get
there ? in much less than a year . ? he was afraid that the university would
begin to grumble if i was gone for much more than 2 years . ? any suggestions ?
?
thank you again for your help , and i look forward to hearing from you .
