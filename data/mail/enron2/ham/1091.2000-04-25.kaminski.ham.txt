Subject: re : real options conference in cambridge
steve
given the practitioner audience , i would prefer a less technical
presentation . perhaps if you can talk about use of real options at enron in
general , and then give some examples ( graphically - - no notation ) of
diagrammatic representation might be good . remember there are many talks
and the capacity of the audience to absorb notation , grammar , and technical
detail is limited .
how about a more generic title " real options at enron ? "
please give me your title within enron please
