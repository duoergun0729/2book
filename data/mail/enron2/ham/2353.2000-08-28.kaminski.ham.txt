Subject: research group
hello norma :
in answer to your phone message i am sending you the following information .
there is one thing you probably need to be aware of . on the research
list , elena chilkina is shown as an analyst p / t , however , in the records she
is shown as an " adm coord " . this was done so that she could be considered
non - exempt and receive overtime . however , her actual job is an analyst .
also , roman zadarozhny is an analyst that rotated out of our group 6 months
ago , but was never moved to the new group . he is now up for rotation again
and vince said that we will just keep him until he finds a new rotation .
if you have any questions , please call me .
