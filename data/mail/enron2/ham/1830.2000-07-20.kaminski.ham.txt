subject : request for visit and meeting
hi grant , we met briefly a couple of months ago . i work with pedro in the
colombia office . we are working closely with ecopetrol ( colombia ' s
state - owned oil company ) on a very important deal , and some of their highest
ranking officials ( 3 of them ) will like to visit our head quarters in early
august , to share some ideas on risk management tools ( very general concepts
that can obviously be disclosed ) .
my assumption is that vince and your - self are the perfect people to have the
meeting with . several consulting firms have advice ecopetrol to get in touch
with enron when referring to advance risk management techniques . do you think
this is possible ? please let me know , this means a great deal for this
office , but i also know you guys are extremely busy . thanks ,
carlos e
