research . i ' ll be following up with him , and his recommendations for project
proposals next week .
also , i ' ve discussed with our university affairs team setting up the
faculty tours - - we ' re ready when you are ! ! the sooner the better - - i ' d love to
get these in pretty immediately , and in any event , before the reception at
the end of the month . i " ll have cindy derecskey in my group email you - - she
is prepared to set these tours up .
i look forward to continuing to develop the multiple potential dynamics of
the enron - rice relationship !

happen . i look for the program to be full before the deadline of december lst . also , i am happy to help organize a group to tour enron . if you were
