Subject: analysis of dabhol energy cost
jeff ,
i am forwarding an analysis put together by sandeep kohli and reviewed by
vince and me . the results in the attached word document show that dabhol
energy costs are several cents below that of roughly 600 mw of distributed
generation which has been identified in maharastra . this 600 mw does not
include innumerable small generators which will have even worse energy
costs . the excel spreadsheet contains the data and calculations .

vince / stinson ,
please find the two attachments that give a more detailed calculation , as
well as the revised statement that can be made to press .
the numbers are not small , but really do not reflect the true magnitude of
the genset issue . they do not take into account the capital costs of the
gensets , and also do not focus on the many smaller units that are operating
in homes , and commercial establishments .
hope ths helps .
regards ,
sandeep .
