our convention is whoever finalizes the model should write the
documentation . it does not make sense
to write one when changes are anticipated . you have been working on this
almost a year , it never
strikes you that we need a documentation ?
i created exotica . xll , does that also give you an excuse not working on
exotica documentation ?

i am surprised that we do not have the documentation ready .
i can make that for you . it is not there because you did not put that
together by the time it was created and all the changes i have made did not
required changes on the functionality .

tai woo ,
here are the c - codes for the crudeapo . ' sig ' is the spot
volatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period .
you should consult with pavel for the definition of this " extra "
parameters . we
would like to see the position monitor once you get it running .
we might have some additional suggestions .
paulo ,
why don ' t we have a documentation on crudeapo you worked on ?
i can not find it in exotica help file . please supply that to tai , thanks .

his asian option portfolio .

the difference made to the model .

input parameter ' sig ' is .
thanks ,
