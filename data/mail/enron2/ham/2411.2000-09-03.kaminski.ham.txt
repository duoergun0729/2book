hello mike ,
i work in rodney malcolm ' s commercial transaction group , focusing on
developing energy management relationships with large volume industrial
energy consumers . due to the volatility and high price levels of the natural
gas contract , these consumers of natural gas are extremely concerned about
this exposure , and they are asking for our assistance in helping them manage
this exposure . one of the tools that these customers are requesting is
technical analysis of the natural gas contract so as to determine entry
points for their hedges .
to the extent you could assist us with this analysis , we can proactively
meet these customer requests and increase our deal flow .
please advise as to the availability of your assistance .
