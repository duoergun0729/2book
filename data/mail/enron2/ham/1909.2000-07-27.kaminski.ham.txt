mark ,
steve ' s comment has many merits . i think stinson gibner and grant masson
( physics ph . d . ' s ) can help to identify
academic and industry sources to validate some of the claims .
on the other hand , even if our guests were wrong by a factor of 2 or 3 in
their time estimates , the technology
they develop will bring about a technological revolution with enormous
potential payoffs . it make sense to
stay close to them and to explore potential investment opportunities .

i think it would be useful to verify their view that they are really only 2 - 3
years from commercial production . ideally , we could get that confirmation
from someone familiar with the technology but without any financial interest
in its success . their technology pitch sounded good , but i don ' t know enough
to recognize the potential shortcomings . i want to feel comfortable that you
all feel this is real , then i would be happy to have me and my team spend
some time with them .

thank you for participating in yesterday ' s meeting . we spoke with harvey and
jim after the meeting and they took to speed to market comments to heart .
there is an opportunity for enron to participate with mec in the early
development of their company , but it seems the one thing they want is the one
thing we also want , people . i would appreciate your thoughts and comments on
the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with mec as
part of a potential investment and strategic relationship . given our
resource constraints , this would most likely be part of the organization that
sees the greatest strategic impact from mec ' s development .
