vince ,
sounds like there are several enron people very interested in our
seminar . many thanks for passing the idea around .
do you think that these groups might provide some sponsorship ? i didn ' t
know whether you have already asked them and they are thinking about it or
whether i need to approach them directly . i would appreciate any
suggestions you have .
regards ,
hill
