i will be on the call . i may disconnect around 4 : 00 to attend the traders '
daily meeting .
a couple of issues :
1 . would it be possible to get gappy a cell phone for the summer ? he does not
have a phone at home . i think the reason for avoiding installing a phone in
his apartment is the increasing cost of his houston stay .
2 . it is getting noisier here . gappy and i are wandering if we could get
office space downstairs ( that we share ) . we will maintain presence on 44 , but
we will be able to discuss when needed .
