reggie ,
there may already be a request floating around for a standard black office
chair for ebl 972 d . it was stolen over a weekend several weeks ago . in
addition to that one , my own chair at eb 3132 a was stolen this past weekend .
could you come up with a couple of decent ones for us ?
if you need to charge them to us , our numbers are 0011 and 100038 . as
always , call me if you need to at x 58322 .
thanks !
