zimin ,
i have a copy of the article .
i agree with you . the model is
essentially the same ( in intentions ) .
i shall distributed the copy of the paper
to the trades here . it explains
well the logic behind the model and it ' s
an independent source .

vince ,
i got the article . i can make a copy for you when i get back .
the article is pretty much for marketing purpose . my reading
from that paper is as follows :
1 . solve optimal exercise bounday using stocastic dp ;
2 . runing price trajectory to tracking storage level to give average storage
cycling ;
our model addresses the same issues , althrough maybe the implementation is
not quite the same .
i will fax to you if i can find the article here .
regards ,
zimin

inflation modeling , power vol curve ,
mean reverting price & vol model , and i will talk about the spot and
multi - factor models , xll . wednesday , i
will concentrate on the gas storage model with natasha danilochkina .
thursday and friday i will talk to
haakan olafsson , mark jones , anjam , and natasha about uk gas forward curve
simulation , gas swing model ,
and implementation issues of uk virtural storage model . i will give you a
