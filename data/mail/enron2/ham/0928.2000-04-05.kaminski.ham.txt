more general info :
( has a bit more on precip derivatives than usual , given the audience )
finally , according to our traders , cme trading activity is down to a couple
of deals a month .
i ' ll try to dig up some specific articles , but i suspect most of them are in
one way or another cme
press releases so that they will gloss over the low liquidity .
