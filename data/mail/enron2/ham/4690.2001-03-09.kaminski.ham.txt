university , yes i can apply . anyway , thanks again and i am sure we ' ll find a
good answer for this question since here is enron .

below is dicussion between margret daffin and sevil in an e : mail january 26 ,
2001 :
" sevil : first of all we have to get you an hib visa before we can work on
getting you the green card .
after you get your opt , contact me sometime in the summer and i will start
working on your hib visa which we will obtain in approx . october , 2001 . we
cannot start the green card process when you are still on an fl visa - you
have to be on an hib visa . there is no rush - you will have six years on the
hib visa - plenty of time in which to get the green card . "
this was in reference to her note to me , as follows :
" i think i ' ll have time approximately until the end of 2002 by using cpt and
opt . this makes almost two years . if we can start green card process now , do
you think that i would get it before i need hl . in every case , can ' t we start
green card before i get hl ? because i don ' t want to waste these two years
given the fact that green card process is a long process . "
