vince ,
bryan has been unable to find anyone suitable to attend this symposium on
saturday , so has suggested i attend , which i am happy to do . my only
reservation is that my knowledge of this area is very limited , so it is
likely i would just be an observer , rather than a participant . anyway just so
that i am adequately prepared could you briefly describe our current
relationship with this project , and also suggest any reading , like a magazine
or paper , that would quickly aid my understanding of the topics to be
discussed .
many thanks ,
ben

bryan ,
i shall call you later today when i have a chance to read the message from
ben .
i wanted to ask you for a favor ( on a very short notice ) . we are talking to
the wharton school
about setting up a relationship with them and getting involved in one or
more research projects
with them .
one of the potential topics is emerging technologies . the wharton offers a
symposium in paris on june 10
on high tech acquisitions and it would make a lot of sense if you
( or somebody from london you could identify ) could attend and help us to
evaluate the usefulness
of this project .
i am enclosing the message from the person in wharton running this program .
vince

vincent ,
it was truly a pleasure getting to know you in our meeting yesterday , and i
look forward to the prospect of exchanging views in the future on a variety
of topics pertaining to emerging technologies .
per our discussion , i ' ve enclosed three files that include an invitation ,
agenda and rsvp form for the june 10 symposium on high tech acquisitions at
insead . if you or the individual ( s ) who will be attending have any
questions , please email : phanish puranam at : phanis 20 @ wharton . upenn . edu or
you can call him at 215 - 898 - 1231 .
this initiative will be expanded during the coming year and i believe that
enron ' s involvement will give the company access to some of the early
research in progress as it unfolds , and of course , if you become involved
as a partner in the emerging technologies program you would have
opportunities to help guide the direction of the research which is one of
the partnership " benefits . "
our next upcoming events are scheduled for :
friday , september 8
" what next on the internet ? "
this is a faculty update day with industry partners also invited .
we will co - sponsor this with wharton ' s major e - business initiative .
major issues addresses include " new economics of the web " and
" internet , anywhere . "
friday , october 20
" first mover advantage , shakeouts & survival strategies "
designed by the et core group and
presented in collaboration with the e - commerce forum .
as i indicated during our discussion , participation in the emerging
technologies management research program is by invitation and on behalf of
our core faculty , i am pleased to extend an invitation for enron to join
the program .
to assist in your decision , we recommend having a representative attend the
symposium in paris on june 10 to " test drive " the program .
i ' ll send you a formal invitation which you are free to accept at your
convenience , should you agree that enron ' s participation in the et program
would be of value .
please call or email if you have any comments or questions .
best regards ,
michael
