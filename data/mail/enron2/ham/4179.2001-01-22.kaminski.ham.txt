vince and christie :
again , many thanks for inviting and hosting the tiger team for an on - site
visit . it was a wonderful opportunity to meet and attend the very
informative briefings from the many senior level contacts you provided to
learn more about enron overall . it was enlightening and exciting to learn so
much about enron . what a great company ! the trip got rave reviews from the
students . you were delightful and most accommodating hosts .
as for the project , i am in the process of confirming dates and locations
for the weekly thursday ( 4 : 00 - 6 : 00 pm est ) videoconferences with enron and
will copy you on the email to the students . i know they are anxious to begin
to narrow the scope as soon as possible so that can begin the research and
analysis of their particular projects .
thank you for your time and support of the project .
sincerely ,
