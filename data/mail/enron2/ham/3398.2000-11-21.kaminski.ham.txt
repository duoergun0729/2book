Subject: re : tage resume submittal
vince ,
thanks for forwarding the resume . we have generally had great success with
ex - koch people .
he sounds might like he may be a good fit for michael l . miller in principal
investments . at this point
i have very recently inherited two other stron vps from ei and therefore will
probably focus on a few
manager and associates for the near term but i would like to keep james '
resume for further opportunities .
he sounds like someone we should at least meet with and figure out a spot
within wholesale services .
what do you think ?
regards ,
