Subject: final version of the presentation
george ,
here is the presentation . i wasn ' t able to add a table showing the
distribution of bids by fuel type for april 2000 since the database is not
updated . also , in the map i didn ' t make those minor changes . because when i
try to erase those names , the map looks ugly . when i get back from california
let ' s get together and discuss the feedbacks from traders .
sevil ,
