bryan ,
i talked to vasant about the model review in london . he thought that he could
accomplish this from houston ,
but i think direct communication makes things much easier . i think his trip
to london
makes a lot of sense . kmv confirmed the meeting on the 20 th . we hope to get
more information about
the scope of their model and assess its the applicability to your business .
vasant , after a few days of immersion in your operations , will be able to
assess better the usefulness of the
model .

vince - it is highly unlikely that i can make the trip but i spoke with
vasant today and he will try to get to london beforehand and will have good
idea of our needs . hopefully this will not cause too many problems .
