sorry so much time has passed since we last discussed your north american
gas model . i am however still interested in setting up a test process to
familiarize some of our key people with the model and the database , etc .
i am now reviewing the licensing agreement that you submitted in december
and will be back in touch soon . i need to discuss this further with the
business segments , but i suspect that our interest will be focused more on
the long term gas model .
another member of your firm had called last week , but i somehow misplaced
his name and number . i thought that an e - mail response would suffice for
now . my apologies .
regards ,
john goodpasture
