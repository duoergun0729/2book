subject : info about enron ' s bandwidth market
dear dr . kaminski ,
i enjoyed your talk this afternoon at ieor very much .
i wonder if you could point me to some information
resource on enron ' s bandwidth market .
i am a ph . d student at ieor . i work with professor
oren and professor varaiya from eecs department on
the topic of pricing the internet . in particular , i am designing
pricing mechanism in the framework of the diffserv
architecture which is the latest proposal made by
ietf to provide scalable service differentiation .
i would very much like to get in touch with people
in enron working on the similar topics .
thank you very much .
