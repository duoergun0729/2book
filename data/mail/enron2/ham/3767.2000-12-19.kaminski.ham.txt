vince ,
i appologize for shipping another version of the paper so soon after the
last . however , my wife picked me up for some last minute shopping at noon
and i wasn ' t sure i would get back to this before leaving tomorrow . the
only changes in the two documents related to a sentence or two in the intro
plus the addition of " unused information " at the end of the document . the
unused stuff is made up of notes i made from hamel , some news stories ,
press releases , and random thoughts . we probably won ' t use any of this
stuff but i wanted you to have it just in case it might prove useful .
the challenge we face at this stage ( and where i can most use your help ) is
in documenting enron ' s risk management functions in a meaningful way . this
may be best done through examples or in some other way . i think that our
audience would appreciate our including some numerical and detailed
examples ( even if they are to be placed in boxes or sidebars that don ' t
interrupt the flow of the article . if you ' ll make a pass at what you feel
is appropriate i ' ll gladly polish on the words as i try to learn about what
you are doing myself .
vince , i really am enjoying this learning experience . you guys make a
wonderful " lab " .
sally and i are driving to louisiana to pick up her mom tomorrow and then
driving to new orleans and back to waco by saturday . however , i will check
in my e - mail regularly .
your friend ,
john
