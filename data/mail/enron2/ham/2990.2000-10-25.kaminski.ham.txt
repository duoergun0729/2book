good morning vince ,
christie has suggested that i be the liaison for john martin and your
research project ' enron - case study of a company reinventing itself ' .
in john ' s lastest email , he suggested that the first week of december works
with his schedule - up to december 6 th - or the following couple of weeks
after dec . 8 th . do these dates work for you as well ? if so , i will proceed
in booking one hour sessions with the following enron management :

if these dates do not work for you let me know when you are available and i
will try to coordinate with john , jeff , ken and andy . also , i will send an
introductory email to john .
