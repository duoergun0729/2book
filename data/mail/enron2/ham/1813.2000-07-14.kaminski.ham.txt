i agree with vince . ideally , this visit would supplement rather than
duplicate effort . however , on the front end , i would prefer a little
overkill to underkill - especially with respect to the var process . i would
defer to anjam / tanya ' s opinion as to what is necessary to get an initial
comfort level . remember that this is the first cut , but it will need to be
refined over time to the point where it is credible enough to force someone
to take a position down based on the calculatiion . if this causes some
heartburn please refer those people to me .

lloyd ,
speaking from experience , i think that it ' s critical for tanya and anjam to
visit mg in new york
and establish direct relationship with technical people . merging two risk
management systems
requires handling many very technical issues and face to face discussions
between it and quants
will be very helpful .

tanya ,
i think most of your queries can be dealt with on the phone - i ' ll be at mg
with andreas today and we ' ll call you . most of these points have already
been covered with anjam in any case . i ' m also attaching a file downloaded
from mercur ( mg ' s risk aggregation system ) showing monthly total positions
for each metal in each entity . you can fairly easily create tables and graph
what you want to see . we can talk today about getting a full deal download .
regards
