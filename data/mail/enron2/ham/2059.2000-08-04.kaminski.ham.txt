jeff : good talking with you earlier this week and happy to hear that your
conversation with jeff skilling was such a positive one . i am looking
forward to working with you , vince and mark palmer in the near future to put
in place a comprehensive plan to maximize the enron / wharton relationship in a
number of different areas . i also know that a number of the faculty will be
extremely pleased to learn of this news and will be quick to get the ball
rolling .
as promised , i am forwarding a document outlining all on campus sponsorship
opportunities , minus the student business plan competition , for the upcoming
school year . please review and pass it on the celeste roberts , for whom i do
not have an accurate e - mail address . there are a number of student
conferences that you may wish to consider participating in as a means for
getting the enron name in front of them . please don ' t hesitate to contact me
with any questions you may have or requests for additional information .
i will also contact the career management office and ask that they call
celeste to discuss career orientation panel sessions . i know that you must
plan your schedule well in advance and will do my best to facilitate that
process .
thanks again for all you are doing to bring our two institutions together .
it is important and makes a big difference .
look forward to hearing from you soon .
tom
