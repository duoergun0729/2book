Subject: ljm update
vince / stinson :
i just came back from a meeting with accounting ( ryan siueck ) and credit ( rod
nelson - works with bill bradford ) in which we presented the two - factor model
for calculating credit loss on our ljm ' s position . rod seemed positive with
the model conceptual approach . he will position bill bradford on that .
accounting will have a meeting with aa to discuss the treatment on credit
reserves on this deal tomorrow 9 : 00 am . they feel my participation is not
necessary .
at year - end the difference on both valuations - without and with credit risk
- indicates a credit loss of about 100 mm .
