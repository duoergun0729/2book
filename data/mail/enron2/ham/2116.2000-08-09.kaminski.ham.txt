subject : re : pdo
i ' m not sure what to think , other than we really don ' t have a
credible way to determine what will happen with the pdo . one factor
that provides insight into the climate outlook for the next few months
and next few seasons is the expected changes with enso ( for which
there is some demonstrated skill in forecasting ) . the latest
observations show trends to near - normal enso conditions , with
some indication that ocean temperatures will likely be a bit
warmer than normal in the tropics . if this is true , i ' d expect a slight
bias toward el nino - like climate over north america , which would
tend to go against the continuation of cold phase pdo conditions .
best wishes ,
