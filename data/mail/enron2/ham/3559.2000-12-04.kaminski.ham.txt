enron supports employees ' involvement in civic organization
and i think you should continue tour involvement with lwf .
it ' s important that we give something back to society .
you don ' t have to take a day off to attend workshops .

subject : my involvement in leadership fort worth
vince ,
i am currently a candidate member of leadership fort worth through august of
2001 . i don ' t know if you are familiar with leadership houston or any other
leadership group , but it is basically a civic organization that provides a
forum for leaders to learn more about their community and opportunities for
civic leadership . for their first year , members are candidates and must
attend about 1 full - day workshop a month in fw , normally on a thursday .
after that , members can transfer to other leadership cities . i talked with
stinson about the group and he thought i should talk with you about whether
or not i should stay involved with lfw . the attached email describes the
december meeting scheduled for 12 / 14 . thanks
ken
