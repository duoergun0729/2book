subject : my resume
vasant ,
i enjoyed our telephone conversation this morning . from our conversation ,
it sounds like enron is moving out on the cutting edge of risk transfer and
insurance finance . in my mind , there seem to be a myriad number of
interesting opportunities moving forward . as well , i see a number of issues
that would need to be resolved . frankly , i find that quite exciting . i
left academics largely because i wanted to move into a more " front line "
career . while i ' ve enjoyed my work here at the naic , it is still not where i
ultimately see myself . i gathered from your comments some concern about my
being too senior in the organization . if i am interpreting you correctly ,
you are concerned about hands on technical work . i enjoy that immensely and
some of the strengths i bring to the table are the ability to think
creatively about solving financial problems and the the ability to make data
tell the underlying story .
i look forward to talking to you next week . i just found out that our
office building will be closed monday , so i will not be in until tuesday
a . m .
