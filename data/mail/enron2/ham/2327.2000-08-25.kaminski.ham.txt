we have been working the last few days to get ena ' s united way participation
rate up as high as possible . i called earlier about your cost center because
the following 16 employees were listed in power trading , but i believe are
part of the research organization .
if you have a chance , could you encourage them to log onto
http : / / unitedway . enron . com on the intranet and make a contribution to the
united way . the deadline is today .
thanks .
