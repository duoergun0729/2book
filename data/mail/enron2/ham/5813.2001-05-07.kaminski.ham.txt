vince ,
i have left a voice mail to you and will wait to talk to you personally . my brother vikas , who is now in london , is trying to make a switch from consulting world to working for a specific firm . over last few months , i have heard of great deal about the success of enron on line business which fits well in the area of his expertise . i am wondering if you know of some one in london who he can speak to regarding career opportunities .
since i spoke to you last , a number of things have changed . recently , my manadate was broaden to include leading a charge for developing a risk management function for both the domestic and international businesses for gmac . needless to say , this is exciting albeit making the life a little more hectic than usual .
talk to you later .
