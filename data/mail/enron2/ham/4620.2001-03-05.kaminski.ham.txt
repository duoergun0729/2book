iris :
i forwarded the information to donna lowry in our compliance dept . however ,
i am afraid she had bad news .
enron would sponsor the renewals , but the us securities group does not
recognize uk securities exams without further testing here in the us .
she said she would get back with you and explain it in greater detail . but ,
from what i understand , you will need to take some exam here before renewing .
when you hear from her let me know .
