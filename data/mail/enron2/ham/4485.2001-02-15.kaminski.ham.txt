Subject: weather course
vince ,
?
we just wanted to let you know that we only have 3 people signed up for the
weather derivatives course ( all from enron ) so far . ? we have a couple more
that have expressed strong interest , but we are awaiting their final
decision . ? if no one else signs up , chris and les thought that you guys
could probably get through the first day pretty easily , ? and thus thought it
may be an option to teach just the 2 nd day material ( pricing ) only at enron
( doing it at the hyatt is an option as well but the room might be on the
large side ) ? ? we would obviously reimburse you for the day not taught . ? we
can teach both days as well , but thought you may want to save some time . ?
?
i just wanted to give you some time to think about it . ? we will know where
we stand on final numbers by next wednesday .
