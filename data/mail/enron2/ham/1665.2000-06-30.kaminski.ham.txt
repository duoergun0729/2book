i just wanted to touch base and see if i needed to snail mail a copy of my
resume or get in touch with anyone else over at enron . ?
?
the finance department at lsu will be sending out financial award letters to
new ph . d . students before long , and my interning at enron would free up some
additional departmental funds . ? in addition , if i will be here in baton
rouge during the fall , i will need to pay my tuition next month . ? i am able
to pursue an internship in large part because of the department ' s
cooperation and assurance that when i return i will still have a research and
or teaching assistantship to help fund the completion of ph . d . ? i have been
told that such cooperation and assurances are rare at lsu , so i am trying to
rock the boat as little as possible .
?
i realize until i receive an offer from enron my internship ( i say
internship rather than sabbatical because lsu will not continue to pay me my
stipend while i am away ) is not assured until an offer has been extended by
enron . ? i understand that there are procedures ? and protocols that must be
followed before this occurs , and i would be willing to do whatever is
necessary to move to the next step in that process .
?
i will be in houston on july 8 & 9 for my wife ' s grandmother ' s 80 th
birthday . ? if it would be convenient , i could be in town ? on the preceding
friday , or following monday for a visit and / or interview . ? if not , given the
relatively close proximity between baton rouge and houston , i would be happy
to come at another time .
?
thanks again ,
shane green
