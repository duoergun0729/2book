Subject: anshuman shrivastava
sandeep : vince has asked me to coordinate with margaret daffin in our
international group to ensure that we acquire an ll visa for anshuman . this
visa has to be in place before he will be able to work in the united states
in any capacity . ( anshuman cannot work in the us on a b - 1 visa - - he can only
come here for business meetings or training . ) there are still several items
remaining to be completed for the l - 1 process . the first is a fairly
detailed job description for anshuman . secondly , we will need to know
whether or not he will either be in a managerial position or whether he will
be managing a project while he is here in houston . vince thought that you
would be best able to provide this information to us , and we would really
appreciate anything you can do to help us expedite this process .
if you have any questions , please give me a call at x 34804 . thank you for
your help .
