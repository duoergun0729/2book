this correspondence is sent to you in response to the below question
pertaining to the type of research that should be introduced to enron .
on tuesday , april 4 th , 2000 , a local newspaper in my area , " the bakersfield
california " ran an article pertaining to the 50 million dollars of funding
from the u . s . congress set aside to study deep sea floor extraction of
methane hydrate . this study will focus on methane hydrates as an energy
source and the technologies needed for safe , efficient development .
according to this article , the ice - like deposits of frozen methane have an
energy potential equal to more than twice that of all other fossil fuels
combined .
i can fax you a copy of this newspaper article if you would like to read it .
send me you fax number or call me at enron wind corp . 661 - 823 - 6433 .
also when i was in engineering student back in 1985 , i did an independent
senior level study on a proposed method which possibly could be used to
extract hydrate from the sea floor . if you are interested , i could e - mail you
a copy of my thesis explaining this proposed method .
