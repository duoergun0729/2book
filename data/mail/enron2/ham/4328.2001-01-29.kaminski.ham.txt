i discussed this with vince kaminski and he said that , while we would be
glad to assist you , the time involved in ordering and collecting the money
( they are pretty expensive ) , distributing the books , etc . would be too time
consuming for us at this time .
you can go to www . lacimagroup . com and order the books directly . tell
them you are ordering the books for use at enron and they should give you
a 15 % discount .
i am sorry that we cannot do this at this time .
