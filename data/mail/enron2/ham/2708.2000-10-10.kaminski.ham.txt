subject : seismic data on oil & gas field development via satellite
mike ,
using nasa satellite transmission of maritime data and establishing a houston
data center to consolidate and centrally process 3 d seismic data surveys for
oil and gas extraction , exploration and development could save the petroleum
industry more than $ 300 million dollars annually through reduced operational
expenses . added value in shortening the time to process and deliver the
finished surveys should generate more than $ 26 million per site ( based upon
$ 15 / barrel for average oil well production to market 30 days sooner ) in
revenue . by re - selling this data to market analysts or by internally using
this data for forecasting future oil / gas production enron could increase the
accuracy of forecasting reserves and production capabilities globally . by
holding the data as exclusive ( or partially exclusive ) , enron would have a
significant market advantage in futures pricing for oil and gas . ( vince ' s team
is quantifying the valuation of this information )
attached please find an updated version of the business case for seismic data
transfer via satellite , by a geophysicist at spacedata - william k . aylor ,
calculated using $ 22 / barrel oil .
based upon your availability , jon adler and i would like to make a
presentation to you ( or your designated representative ) on the enron
potential of this opportunity , sometime next week ( 17 - 20 october ) .
