Subject: projects update
vince ,
a quick project update .
1 . sandeep and i spoke with robert schenck in adelaide . he will email a
henwood proposal to us . they already figured that we must be interested in
modelling dabhol .
2 . the wti eol trading simulation had an error . we were counting a
mid - offer spread profit on each trade , but we actually would make the spread
on each round - trip transaction ( one trade to open , one trade to close ) . i
modified the calculation and sent the new numbers to greg whalley ( he is the
one who caught the mistake , so there goes my bonus for the year . ) and john
lavorato . i should probably re - run the earning volatility numbers , and
update ted murphy as well .
