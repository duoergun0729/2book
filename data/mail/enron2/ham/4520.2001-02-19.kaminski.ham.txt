vince ,
enron is fine ( although i think we have to pay for the hyatt anyway ) .
?
good discount ( i have a feeling that my idea of a good discount and the
weather desk ' s idea is probably different ? ) : ? for the one day , $ 1100 per
person . ? if you think that there will be ? around 10 people or more , then we
can offer a day rate , regardless of the number of people . ?
?
thanks vince
?
julie
?
ps - of course when i announced that we were cancelling , people started
responding that they wished to attend . ? ugh !
?

julie ,
enron location makes more sense . no reason to pay for the hotel .
also , i think that one day makes more sense .
i contacted the weather desk about including other people at the training
course . i think that they would be interested if they got a good discount .

vince ,
great . just to let you know , we decided not to wait on the indecisive
ones , and postponed the open course . it ' s yours , whatever you want : ? 1
day ( specific to what you feel will be of the most benefit ) , 2 days , hyatt
or ? enron , or not at all . i hope this doesn ' t cause problems for you .
special deal , for sure . i owe my godfather .

enron
and ? increase the # of people attending . i am forwarding your message to
our ? weather desk .
vince
joe ,

vince ,
we just wanted to let you know ? that we only have 3 people signed up for
the
weather derivatives course ? ( all from enron ) so far . we have a couple more
that have expressed strong ? interest , but we are awaiting their final
decision . if no one else signs ? up , chris and les thought that you guys
could probably get through the ? first day pretty easily , and thus thought
it
may be an option to teach just ? the 2 nd day material ( pricing ) only at
enron
( doing it at the hyatt is an ? option as well but the room might be on the
large side ) ? we would ? obviously reimburse you for the day not taught . we
can teach both days as ? well , but thought you may want to save some time .
i just wanted to give ? you some time to think about it . we will know where
we stand on final ? numbers by next ? wednesday .
