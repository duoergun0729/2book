cindy ,
yes , it ' s just around the corner and we have our very best program ever .
our web site is up at
check it out . actually , i was waiting for the final version of the program
from sheridan to post it before getting in touch with you this week . we
are planning on a room capacity group of 45 - 50 folks and are finalizing the
plans for entertainment for friday and saturday night on the riverwalk .
bill is handling the arrangements this year and i ' ll pass this message on
to him as well .
do you think we could get an enron speaker for saturday ' s luncheon ? last
year was fabulous and would be hard to top but we ' d like to try . san
antonio should be a bit easier on the speaker too . let me know what your
thoughts are on everything including the speaker .
bill and i are leaving town wed afternoon to go to a harvard conference so
maybe we could talk before then .
we ' re getting excited and want to get you guys involved for it is your
personal ( and financial ) support that makes the conference really work .
