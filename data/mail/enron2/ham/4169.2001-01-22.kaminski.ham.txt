efficient . please suggest the structure / clauses / information required by which
we need not pay withholding taxes . if you need more info on the scope of work
contemplated you can talk to wade / neil / sandeep .

wade / mohan ,
please find below the last draft copy of the henwood consulting agreement .
we need to sign this asap so as to not be in violation of ene policies .
as you will see , the draft agreement is made out with enron in mind , even
though we have left the company name blank in the agreement .
mohan - last when we spoke ( friday ) , you were going to explore the tax
aspects of having dpc be the signing company . please tell us if that works .
separately , you and wade may need to consider how dpc lenders may look upon
some of the information emerging from this study , and whether you want all of
it in lender domain .
based on the same you may want to decide whether this needs to be eipl , ene
houston , or dpc . we could also have a version where ene houston is signing
the contract on behalf of dpc .
please let me know what you decide , and we will proceed accordingly . if you
would like someone in eipl / dpc to be signing the contract , please let me
know , who the signing authority is . i suspect , that even i could sign on
behalf of dpc or ene ? ? if so , i will be in houston on wednesday , and sign
at the time . if not , you can assign someone to sign .
regards ,
sandeep .

i suspect that enron india llc would be the entity to use . however , is
anyone from tax involved in this ? if not , we need to get someone in the
loop .
