at enron box at enron field
christie :
could you please fill me in on the logistics ? dr . gillis and gil whitaker
will
be at the apl project presentation at enron at 4 p . m . . further , they both
plan
to attend the dinner at enron field . however , dr . gillis must skip the
game due
to an early morning breakfast the next day . will you provide special parking
at the dinner / game ? i think dr . g and gil will go together , then i will have
dr . gillis picked up by limo , at approximately 8 : 00 p . m . does this sound
feasible ?
