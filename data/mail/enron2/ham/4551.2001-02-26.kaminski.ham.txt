Subject: re : ut conference trustees ' meeting
vince , there was a trustees ' meeting ( during dinner ) which i attended .
here are a few things that were discussed there :
1 . april 4 th is the date when different companies representatives will come
on ut campus to tell mba
students about their companies and job opportunities . the companies will have
to pay a small fee ( about
$ 200 ) to be able to participate .
2 . trustees ' continued support for in - class presentations , finance challenge
program and practicums .
i understand that ut wants you to give some classes in the autumn semester
for mba students .
3 . some companies ( like reliant ) select some well defined projects and give
them to ut students to
work on for a few months . students work in teams and discuss their progress
with ihud ron and then
report results to the company .
regards ,
tanya .
