Subject: phone interview
per our conversation yesterday , i will have a job description for the comp
finance students sometime today . i have also gone through the mba resume
stack yet again . the person who requested the phone interview is troy
mischke . he works for pratt & whitney in florida . cmu has a flexmode
program , which is another phrase for distance learning .
it turns out that there are a number of people that work for pratt & whitney
in florida . my guess is that they all know each other , and decided to take
the flexmode program together . here are the names
tony garcia
k . todd kuykendall
timothy leonard
troy mischke
only troy requested the phone interview , although tony gacia did send a
cover letter . what is the best path forward ?
