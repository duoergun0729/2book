if it ' s new ebs products you ' re after , how about a real - time bandwidth swing
contract with automatic exercise ? the customer pays for the minimum
( baseload ) bandwidth they need for their ( say ) videoconference , with a
premium on top that automatically buys them extra bandwidth as it becomes
available from the system . they are guaranteed a minimum quality they can
live with , and ( more than likely ) they get improved quality much of the time
for a bargain price .
we get to charge for the use of bandwidth that would otherwise be idle .

steve ,
i think personally it ' s a great idea , though my son , who studies
computer science , poured a bucket of icy water on me . computers
are becoming very cheap and most companies have already a lot of
spare capacity on their systems .
but we can always try . we shall take this idea , to the person in ebs
responsible for the
new products and ask him to talk directly to you to discuss the details .
ebs is dying to come up with some new products .

have any investigations been made of the issue of trading ( spare ) processing
power ? such a proposal would have natural synergies with the bandwidth
business , since the jobs to be processed would need to be piped around , as
would their results .
obvious technical and legal problems are :
1 . standardisation . ( java ? )
2 . security and confidentiality .
just a thought that ' s been buzzing around my head for a while .
