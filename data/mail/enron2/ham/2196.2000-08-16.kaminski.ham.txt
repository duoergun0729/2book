Subject: re : agenda for thursday ' s meeting
hello all ,
i look forward to this meeting . since the time vince and i last spoke , we
have really gained some traction in this area of improving our relationships
with universities . i am going to take the liberty of inviting mike rosen to
the meeting . mike has done a great job on several relationship - based special
projects , and i ' d like to hear his thoughts as we develop the angles of this
initiative .
see you tomorrow ,
