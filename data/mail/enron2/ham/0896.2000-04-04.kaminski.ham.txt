subject : re : energy derivatives conference - may 29 , toronto
ms . crenshaw ,
thank you for sending the bio so quickly . it ' s exactly what i was looking
for .
we are planning to compile the conference speakers ' papers for distribution
to the participants . while i will not need dr . kaminski ' s contribution for
several weeks , an abstract of his presentation as soon as possible would be
very useful to the conference organizers .
i will also need the following information :
- dr . kaminski ' s audio / video equipment requirements for his presentation
- will he be joining the conference organizers and speakers for dinner on
may 29 ?
- which nights will he be staying in toronto ? i will reserve a room at the
conference hotel
- any dietary restrictions or special requests
your help is much appreciated .
best wishes ,
amy
