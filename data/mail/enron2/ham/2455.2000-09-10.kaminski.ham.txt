pierre - philippe ,
thanks for your message . i shall be glad to make a presentation in early
november . i understand the presentation are on fridays and november the 3 rd
would be the best date for me .
if you prefer november the 10 th , we have to wait a few more days with the
decision . we have a management conference every year in san antonio and it
will be held either in the 2 nd or the 3 rd week of november . i shall know in a
few days . the same goes for november 9 , assuming it was not a mistake ( it ' s
thursday ) .
i shall be free for dinner on the day of the conference . thanks for the
invitation .
