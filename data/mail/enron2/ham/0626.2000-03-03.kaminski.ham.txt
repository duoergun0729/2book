Subject: our meeting next week
vince and grant ,
first let me apologize for cancelling our meeting with you this friday . i
hope we can reschedule next week as i ' ll arrive in houston monday mid - day .
i ' d love to talk to you as i know the knowledge base in your group related to
my new responsibilities is huge . will you be able to free up some time of
some of your team members to help us ?
as an example , i ' d like to show you our position book ( cash ) . it ' s far from
being perfect . i ' d like to know whether we should persevere and improve it
or whether there are some models in ena that we could copycat . . . .
i look forward to seeing you next week ,
remi
