Subject: recommendation for john gordon
dear vince ,
i am writing to bring to your attention a gsia student , john gordon , who is
currently being considered for enron ' s associates program . my understanding
is that mark courtney and andrew miles at enron are championing john as a
late addition to the program .
while i know enron doesn ' t routinely recruit at gsia , john would be an ideal
candidate if you are willing to make an exception . he is a terrific finance
student with a strong transcript ; including an a + in my options class . since
john has an engineering / energy background , he asked early on for additional
background reading about finance and energy . john is personable and
outgoing . normally the job market for someone of john ' s caliber would have
already cleared , but i have been told that there are dual career issues at
play here .
i would be very appreciative if you would take a look at john . a copy of
his resume is attached to this email .
best regards ,
duane
