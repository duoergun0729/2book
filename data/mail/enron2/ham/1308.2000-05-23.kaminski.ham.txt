Subject: re : real options article
steve ,
the journal of risk is a more technical and serious publication
than risk magazine .
if the article is published it will give you more exposure in
the academic circles . i think it will be a significant
accomplishment .
on the downside , it does not receive the same wide circulation as risk
among the practitioners .
i can also see the reason behind the recommendation given
by navroz : the article is fairly long for risk .

steven ,
after further consultation with the technical editor , we feel that your work
would find a more suitable environment for exposure in the journal of risk .
?
if you email a copy of your work ( to the editor - in - chief , philippe jorion )
and outline what has happened to :
?
? pjorion @ uci . edu
?
then i am sure that they will be keen to give due consideration .
?
thank you for your interest and sorry for the delay in coming to this
decision .
?
best wishes ,
?
navroz patel ,
technical assistant , risk magazine .
