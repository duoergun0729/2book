Subject: updating your profile information in the gis system
as the global vp / md mid - year prc draws closer , i want to take the opportunity
to stress to you the importance of updating your profile information in the
gis system . details on your current responsibilities , employment history ,
skills and education should have been updated by 7 july 2000 . for those of
you that have not opened your profile in gis , i urge you to do so as soon as
possible to ensure that your profiles are current and complete .
gis is accessible via the hrweb home page on the intranet . you may go to
hrweb . enron . com and look for the gis link , or just type eglobal . enron . com on
the command line of the browser .
your timely response to this request is greatly appreciated .
