Subject: latest draft - - comments ?
vince ,
this is my latest effort and i would appreciate your thoughts . i know that
we haven ' t written together before so let me assure me that you will not
hurt my feelings by " slashing away " with a red pen . i think that i have
put all the clay on the table for this piece of sculpture but it is still
pretty crude . help me " refine " the work to create something we can both be
very proud of .
by the way , i know you are extremely busy right now so don ' t feel pressured
to spend lots of time here . any guidance you can offer will be
appreciated . i don ' t know what the editor ' s time schedule is but he asked
me to send him a draft on monday . you and i will still be able to edit the
manuscript but he will begin reading and editing it too . i ' ll let you know
as soon as i have a final deadline .
your friend ,
john
p . s . hope life is a bit calmer for you . by the way , i ' m reading an
interesting book entitled " the four agreements " by miguel ruiz that
documents the toltec philosophy of life in the context of the dreams of
reality that we all create . you might enjoy it .
