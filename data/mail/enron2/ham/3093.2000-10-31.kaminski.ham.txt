Subject: kin tso - ut candidate for direct hire
vince ,
just wanted to follow up on our conversation yesterday regarding kin tso .
charlene actually called kin yesterday to let him know that your group was
interested in him as a direct hire and would be contacting him this week . as
we discussed , kin was told that his quantitative skills were a much better
fit for your group instead of our rotating associate program . we let him
know that the associate program would not be making him an offer but he is
being considered for a direct hire . kin was receptive and is looking forward
to hearing from you . we will consider this issue closed from the associate
and analyst program . we hope that you might find a direct hire fit for him
in your area . if you have any additional questions , please let me know .
thanks so much .
