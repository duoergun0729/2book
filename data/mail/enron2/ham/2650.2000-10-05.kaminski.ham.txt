winners and losers in the e - commerce shakeout

friday , october 20 ( conference )

conference themes & objectives
e - commerce is heading inextricably and rapidly toward an inevitable
shakeout and consolidation that tends to characterize every major new
industry . this impact conference bringstogether a distinguished group of
industry and academic leaders to discuss what is required to survive the
e - commerce shakeout , and what it takes to be a " winner " when the shakeout
hits , full - force .
shakeouts are spawned in the boom - and - bust environment of hot emerging
markets . an unsustainable glut of competitors is attacted by the
contagious enthusiasm for the emerging technology . as competition
intensifies and falling prices put pressure on margins there is a wave of
ailures and mergers that removes the weaker players .
few ecommerce markets - - whether e - tailing online exchanges or others - - - will
be exempted from the forces that cause shakeouts . this conference will
combine lessons from markets that have experienced shakeouts , with the
latest thinking about the unique features of e - commerce , to identify
successful strategies for surviving a shakeout .
questions to be addressed include :
- are the patterns seen in previous shakeouts of high technology markets
applicable to ecommerce ? what are the early warning signs of an impending
shakeout ?
- which ecommerce markets are most susceptible to a shakeout ? will there
be single or multiple winners ?
- which companies are likely to survive ? what strategies will the winners
use ?
there is controversy and uncertainty about which factors will most
contribute to prospects for survival . how important are first mover
advantages and building brand equity ? what do incumbents have to do to
prevail ? which business models are most robust ? how important is the
ability to manage strategic partnerships ?
these issues will be addressed with a program that encourages active
dialogue and interaction and includes speakers from industry , academia and
wall street .
