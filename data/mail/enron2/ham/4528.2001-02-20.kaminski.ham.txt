Subject: schedules , maps , etc .
gentlemen :
attached is a schedule of activities as well as maps and driving
instructions for those who are driving to campus friday morning . the dress
for friday is casual ( no ties , sport shirts and jackets if you wish ) .
for those of you who have asked about thursday night ' s dinner please note
that we have pushed it up to 6 - 8 pm at ninfa ' s mexican restaurant . at this
point i plan to pick up bennett s . and don c . from the marriott before 6
and will do the same for anyone else ( let me know ) . the restaurant is in
easy walking distance of the hilton and marriott .
please note the times for your individual interviews / video taping on
friday . some of you are leaving early so we are taping you from 11 - 12
friday morning while others are being taped after the program is over .
i ' m sure i ' ve forgotten something so you ' ll probably get more e - mails .
however , this should take care of the primary stuff . i ' m really looking
forward to seeing all of you and to hearing your thoughts in the workshops .
more later ,
