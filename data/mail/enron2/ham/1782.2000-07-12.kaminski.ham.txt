Subject: associate prc , martin lin
dave ,
you are representing martin lin , an associate currently in the research
group , at the mid - year prc . we would like to promote martin to a manager
position in the research group , so you will need to nominate him for
promotion at the prc meeting for us .
martin has spent the last four months supporting ebs . his primary project
has been development of a simulation model for analyzing the capability of
the media - cast product running on the ebs network . this type of analysis is
critical to understanding what types of bottlenecks we might encounter in
trying to service , for example , the blockbuster deal . martin has already
come up to speed so that he is able to largely replace an expensive
contractor from lucent who is under contract to support this modelling
effor . prior to supporting ebs , martin used his engineering skills ( b . s .
caltech , ph . d . u . of texas in ee ) to create models of regional power
transmission networks in order to better understand possible congestion
constraints .
in our internal pre - ranking meeting we felt that martin was deserving of a
rating of superior due to his technical excellence , his excellent attitude
and work ethic , and his ability to move projects forward with minimal
supervision .
regards ,
stinson
