subject : copper curve
following steve ' s note to you earlier today , i wanted to mention that we have
a fairly urgent need for review of the copper curve in particular , as there
is a deal due for final pricing in the next few days .
i am not sure what data you have received from enron metals in london , so i
am asking tim poullain - patterson to ensure that you have the curves and the
economic justification proposed as soon as possible . please direct any
questions to him or to harry tefoglou . i will be in the tokyo office next
week , but available via e - mail .
thanks in advance for your assistance ,
