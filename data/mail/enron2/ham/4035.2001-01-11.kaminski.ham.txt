Subject: sr . director position
vince : as you requested , i have obtained some information from norma
relating to the salary parameters of the sr . director position . the minimum
salary is $ 83 , 800 , and the maximum is $ 168 , 000 ( huge range , isn ' t it ? ) .
however , norma did ask me to bring a couple of things to your attention : the
lowest salary of a vp in your group is currently $ 140 , 000 , and the average
director ' s salary in your group is $ 120 , 000 . those numbers narrow the
range considerably . of course , there is no equity issue since there is no
other senior director in your group .
hope this information helps ,
