Subject: london research intranet
felipe
following our discussion please close down all intranet access to the london
research group site . inaccuracies have been found in the content which may
have implications for our trading operations . closing the site will force
traders to contact our group direct , ensuring only correct information is
passed .
the site will be completely overhauled over the coming months , so i see
little benefit in reinstating access to the site in the near future .
many thanks ,
steve
