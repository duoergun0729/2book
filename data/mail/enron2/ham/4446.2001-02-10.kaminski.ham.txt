Subject: hello guys ,
i ' m " bugging you " for your completed questionnaire and for a one - page
bio / statement on your thoughts on " business edu and the new economy " . if
my records are incorrect please re - ship your responses to me . i want to
put everything together next week so that i can ship it back to everyone .
the questionnaire is attached as well as copies of the bio pages for
michael froehls and myself ( two somewhat different approaches ) . the idea
of the latter is just to introduce yourself to the other panelists and give
them some background on how you are approaching the issues we will discuss .
we will also provide copies to the attendees and use this material for our
personal introductions at the opening of the panel discussions .
thanks and i look forward to seeing you in two weeks .
