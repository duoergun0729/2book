Subject: eol stuff
vince -
i spoke with tom , and i completely agree and would like to hand all this eol
stuff over to you .
we need a sun server to take over the task . as it happens martin lin has one
in his office he ' s not using and up to the task . his box could serve sas to
enron , as well as handle listening in on the eol feedds and maintaining its
database .
martin ' s box technically belongs to ebs , but i think they are downsizing and
wouldn ' t mind giving it up .
in this way , you would have complete physical and administrative custody over
the data and any work you do with it . i needn ' t be involved , and you can know
your work is completely confidential .
i ' ll make sas and the eol software available , as well as the necessary ram
the server , at no charge . you just need to summon up some sysadmin resources
to finish the job . there is a fine unix guy named ben thompson who will
support you , i ' m sure .
task :
1 ) upgrade ram on martin ' s server
2 ) install newest solaris os on server
3 ) install tibco and gnu software on server
4 ) install sas on server
