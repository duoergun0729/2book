Subject: re : valuation
steve ,
please , let me know when you come back .
i have detected a tendency to implement different
approaches to valuation in the past .
to some extent , it reflects the absence of formal
rules for sign - off on the valuation techniques
which , in turn , reflects , the turf wars and the desire by the
originators to control the outcomes .

vince ,
i ' d like an opportunity to talk to you about valuation .
i ' m hearing confusing messages about the way that the uk it team and the uk
traders get their valuation code aparently signed off by research , while
here . . . you provide it for our guys to wrap up .
we have now a situation where the uk team are using a home grown valuation
piece called dove , where results differ from those of the equivalent usa
portcalc .
i need to break through the pride barriers and the " not built here " syndrome ,
and try to do the right thing , but i don ' t beleive i can do that without you
guidance .
i ' m scared that if we diverge too much we will never work globally on these
systems .
