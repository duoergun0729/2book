please provide comments on the summary below . after i have collected them ,
we can decide to distribute to greg , john , jeff and anyone else involved .
the following is my summary of our collective thoughts regarding the proposed
24 x 7 trading of prompt wti :
1 ) appears advisable to have on - site human monitoring for the following
reasons :
a ) public relations
b ) in case there are operational bugs
c ) unforeseen market events , particulary during off exchange hours , long
weekends , etc
2 ) we advocate some live trading simulation with incentives to " bust " the
system prior to launch to work our
operational glitches , and because the historical simulations used daily ,
not intra - day prices .
3 ) consider a daily position limit ( a sub - limit of the overall global
products limit ) whereby each day , at least once a day ,
the open position will be reduced under the limit ( or to close to flat ? )
4 ) consider a " trigger " whereby the fixed spread widens if a certain number
of consecutive trades occurs on the same
side of the market
5 ) consider the purchase of deep out - of - the - money puts and calls to protect
against extreme events .
