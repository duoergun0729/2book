subject : merit increases
norma ,
it seems that there is a bug in the system . i made an error mixing equity and
merit raises in one column . the system does not allow me to correct the
mistake by
moving the entries from one column to another . i can enter the changes , but
after i save them the system reverts to original designations .
as a result , the columns contain mixed entries related to merit and equity
raises .
the column totals are misleading .
i am taking a csv version home to continue making adjustments .
i shall work at home monday ( 281 367 5377 ) .
