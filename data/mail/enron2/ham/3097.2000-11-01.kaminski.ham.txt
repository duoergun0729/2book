mr . huang ,
we would be happy to demonstrate the features and functionality of the
weatherdelta tool set for your team at enron . early next week ( tuesday or
wednesday ) are both possible , as well as early the following week . the
demonstration can take 90 minutes or more , depending on the number of
questions and the level of detail .
ideally , you could provide us with some of your data and we could
demonstrate how to value a full - requirements contract to service that
particular load . to do this we will need one or more years of hourly
consumption data , and the general location of the load . ideal data formats
are csv files of either 365 rows x 25 columns ( date , hrl , hr 2 . . ) or 8760 rows
x 3 columns ( date , hr , load ) . in lieu of using your data , we will provide
sample load data .
please feel free to call me and we can discuss schedules and the particulars
of the product overview and demonstration .
thank you for your interest ,
michael j . denton
