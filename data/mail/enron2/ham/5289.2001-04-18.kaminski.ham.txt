dear lance ,
thank you very much for all of your help through this process .
at present , i am really tied up with mock market activities in austin
energy . it would be inappropriate for me to leave at this time since the
whole project will be jeopardized . therefore , i decided not coming to
houston for an interview . i sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this
may cause you .
i do appreciate what you did and hope we can keep in touch in the future .
thank you again for your help and wish you best .
sincerely ,
weijun ji
