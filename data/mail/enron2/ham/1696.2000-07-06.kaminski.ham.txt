hello ,
i am on the qa team for the win 2 k roll - out . we need your help in testing
" alcar " in a windows 2000 environment .
this testing is crucial to the success of converting all pc ' s from nt 4 to
windows 2000 . we ask that you make an appointment to come to our offices
( eb 2224 b ) to preform the test . it should not take more than 15 minutes .
please e - mail me as soon as possible .
thanks ,
brenda cassel
