molly ,
i met lou in the building lobby last wednesday and he suggested that he
( or his representatives ) join the mathworks presentation to my group ) .
it ' s a good software package for mathematical modeling ,
but there is a limit to the number of different installations any group
can productively use .
i shall take a look at some new features they offer
and decide whether it ' s worth the effort .

deploying applications to control risk .
