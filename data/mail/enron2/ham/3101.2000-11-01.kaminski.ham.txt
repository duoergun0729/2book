vince ,
i left a message with one of yaron ' s roommates on thursday afternoon for him
to call asap for an interview on sunday . i guess he took the wrong number
down but i do not understand this because the roommate read the number back
to me and it was correct . when i did not hear from yaron i called on friday
and left a voice mail with my cell and office numbers . i still did not hear
from him and called again yesterday morning . i finally received a call at 4
pm yesterday but by that time my team and myself were half way back to
houston . sorry it did not work out . i have a call into charlene jackson as
to how she wants me to proceed and i will get back with you .

apparently the recruiter spoke to one of my son ' s roommates and left a phone
number ( 713 ) 343 - 3214 which he tried several times and got busy signals .
today she called just before you called me and left her cellphone number but
he was in classes all morning and got the message in the afternoon . i really
appreciate your going out of your ? way to help . perhaps there will be another
opportunity . ?
