Subject: re : real options conference in cambridge
lenos
i ' d like to give a talk entitled " diagrammatic representation of real options
in enron " , in which i will give a brief run - down of a diagrammatic technique
i have developed for representing real option deals . my notation allows
originators , managers and quants to communicate unambiguously , while still
appreciating the complexity and subtlety of real optionality . i have defined
a " diagrammatic grammar " which guarantees that the pricing of the deal
follows immediately and automatically from the diagram .
i propose to introduce the symbols and grammar , then go on to present some
suitable examples of diagrams . if appropriate i ' ll talk about the links with
dynamic programming . ( i will need some guidance as to how much technical
detail i can go into based on the audience . )
all the best ,
