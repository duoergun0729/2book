Subject: re : f / u to dr . kaminski @ enron from iris mack
hi again ,
thank you for your email . sorry for the phone tag and email tag . i will
try to call you again next week .
in the mean time , i thought i would send you a couple of documents to give
you an idea of some of the work that i have done that may be of interest to
enron .
1 . the first word document is my london busines school executive mba
thesis relating to weather derivatives .
2 . the second word document describes a hybrid derivatives structure i i
workded on at bnp paribas . it has applications to the enerygy industry .
because these documents are very large i will forward them in two separate
emails . your comments on them would be appreciated .
happy thanksgiving ,
iris
