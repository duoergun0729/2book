vince ,
i certainly think anjam & tanya should visit ny , but i simply had a concern
that some of the questions being asked had already been covered by anjam /
myself and andreas but had somehow not been communicated .
my message was not intended to convey any another impression . i ' ve also now
spoken with anjam
2 . information on exotic options structures ( existing
3 . the data flow ( are we going to get data from london or ny ) .
4 a . storage of positions information at mg . how to extract the positions
info from
mg database into spreadsheets .
4 b . existing positions structure for each metal .
5 . introduction to concentrates trading business , key personnel .
best regards ,
tanya & anjam
