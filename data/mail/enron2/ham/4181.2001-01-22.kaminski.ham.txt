Subject: good morning
vince ,
two items . unless you have an objection , i plan to ship the paper on to
don chew at the journal this morning . we can still work on the article but
he needs something to begin the editing process .
second , in the same issue as our paper will appear the transcript of a
roundtable discussion involving sheridan titman , john mccormack ( stern
stewart ) , ron erd ( southern energy ) , jeff sandifer ( president of sandifer
capital - - $ 700 million undermanagement ) , and gene humphries . attached you
will find a section that will not be in the final document , but that i
thought you might like to read in light of our own discussions over the
course of writing this paper .
have a great day .
