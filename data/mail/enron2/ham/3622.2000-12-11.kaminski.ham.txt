Subject: recommendations
vince and joe ,
this is just a short reminder about the four letters of recommendation .
i have attached an envelope with each recommendation . once you
seal each envelope , please don ' t forget to sign it ( over the adhesive
seal ) and to label the front , e . g . " columbia - joseph hrgvocic " . also ,
i will be mailing everything in one package to each university , so
please don ' t mail them out .
that is all . as always , i really do appreciate the time you ' re taking to
do this .
thank you ,
hector
