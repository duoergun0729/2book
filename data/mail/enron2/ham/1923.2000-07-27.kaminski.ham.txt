Subject: re : enron / stanford program
nick ,
vince asked me to coordinate the planning for you august visit to enron .
vince and i are free almost any date except august 14 and 15 th , but we would
like to try and schedule your visit at a time when you could meet with other
key ebs executives such as kevin hannon and perhaps ken rice and john
echols . if you could send me a few of your preferred choices of dates , i
will try to optimize getting you on the calendars of these individuals .
by the way , giuseppe is doing a great job and has already made a very good
impression on everyone he has worked with . it ' s been a real pleasure having
him here for the summer .
regards ,
stinson
