Subject: houston research opportunity
dear vince i would like to make
the suggestion that we make this opportunity a one - year assignment working
with tanya , and then re - evaluate the situation at the end of the year in
terms a new role for me in houston thereafter , subject to mutual agreement .
the alternative situation of resigning from enron europe and re - joining enron
corp is too dramatic and requires me to " burn bridges " and my return to enron
europe would be difficult . also , i would lose the valuable support
structures available to me in london . the amount of any fixed costs
( flights , modest cargo , a few months of mortgage carrying cost ) are entirely
reasonable , not excessive given my single status and not so great that they
justify making the contract a three year ( local ) one .
i would expect that on the basis of almost 3 1 / 2 years solid experience &
value - added at enron europe , the value of several million pounds i have
identified & justified to external auditors for enron europe this year and an
" excellent " rating ( my fourth making my 3 1 / 2 yr average rating also
" excellent " ) , i could reasonably be expected to justify a fair deal ( i . e . my
existing enron europe salary & benefits package plus a reasonable one - off
allowance to cover unavoidable additional personal expenses ) .
regards & thanks again for the opportunity ,
anjam
