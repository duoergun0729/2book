feeling much better . eventhough i was out last week , i finished the
following curves :

we also helped london rac with finding information on the uk inflation model
to backtest it . gwyn and yana kept me very busy last week . yana , who lives
close by me was nice enough to drop off work at night . gywn and i worked on
the curves over the phone .
yesterday , i got a call from terry thorn , he needed economic information and
a presentation to give to egm management . i gave him a copy of the
conforming assets presentation , he was very pleased . this week , i ' m working
on a urgent request from rac . the board has decided to resurrect dragon 2 ,
so we are preparing all the curves for the apachi region . i ' m also working
on the metals presentation . see you thursday .
