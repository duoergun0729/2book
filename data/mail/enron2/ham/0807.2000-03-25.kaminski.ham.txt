interested in your products . bryan seyfried , who is heading up the credit
trading operations in london , would like you to visit the london office when
you
are there next friday . he would like to discuss technical implementation
details at that time , in addition to the overall framework . i will also
give
you a call to set up a time to have a more technical ( options modeling )
conversation over the phone .
