dear mr . kaminski :
how are you doing ?
i called you on may 11 th about my first rotational assignment . you
recommended risk management and asked me to email you my resume .
it seems like risk management group are not very interested in me ,
because
i
haven ' t received any feedback from them yet . do you think i should wait
for
a few days or call them ?
i do appreciate your help , which will make a difference on my career
path .
sincerely
xiaojun george huan
