Subject: houston visit
dear research and related group team members ,
i will be visiting the houston office from monday 10 th july and hope to have
another very useful information exchange , including updating you all on the
activities in the london office by means of a presentation . for those of you
who are unfamiliar with me , i have been looking after quantitative analysis
for the european markets for the last 3 + years , in particular focusing on
derivatives pricing and risk management techniques ( e . g . load forecasting ,
inflation curve building , financial options on real power stations etc . ) -
look forward to meeting you all again soon .
best regards ,
