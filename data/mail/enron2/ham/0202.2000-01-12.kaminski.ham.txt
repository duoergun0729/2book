considered
for the conference . it is being held in washington , dc on june
19 - 20 , 2000 .
if your schedule allows , please join our speaking faculty . you will
notice

energy price
risk " is not currently on the agenda . we can add it once you have a
chance

any
colleagues or industry professionals who can add expertise to the
conference
as well .
if you have any questions or concerns , please do not hesitate to
