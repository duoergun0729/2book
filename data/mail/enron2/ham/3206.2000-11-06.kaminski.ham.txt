vince ,
i wanted to email you and let you know how sorry i am that i was not able to
make your presentation at carnegie mellon . i really was looking forward to
the trip and the presentation but unfortunately since i have been on the road
a lot lately things started backing up in the office . after my meeting on
thursday there was no way i would make the 6 pm flight and my original flight
would have put me in pittsburgh to late for the presentation .
anyway , i hope you understand and i am looking forward to working with you in
december for the interviews on campus . maybe once you return you can give me
a recap of the days events . in the meantime if you need any assistance
please do not hesitate to call .
thank you ,
kristin gandy
