stinson ,
?
here are some options considering what you have
said :
?
1 ) ? we can do a full week of class from may 7 to 11 .
?
2 ) ? the second option is to split the course over two weeks .
if you cannot possibly accomodate a full week of training
then we can try this . ? we have done this before and it has
worked fairly well . ? it would be like :
?
week 1 ( 20 hours ) : ? feb 20 - 23 , tue - fri , 12 : 00 to 5 : 00
week 2 ( 20 hours ) : ? april 9 - 12 , mon - thu , 12 : 00 to 5 : 00
?
these are the only two weeks that are available for venkat
to teach before may 7 th date . ?
?
please let me know if these would work . ? i look forward to
hearing from you . ?
?
regards ,
?

stinson ,
i have attached a file along with this email
that lists the software needed for our
java class .
we would like to do the class from monday thru
friday , 8 am to 5 pm . ? that way we can complete
the class within a ? week . ? we are unable to offer
classes in the evenings or for few hours a week .
we usually teach week long courses for our
other clients and because of that ? we won ' t
be available .
currently , we can do the class from feb . 19 th
through feb . 23 ( that is if you are working on
feb 19 th , president ' s day ) .
i will call ? you sometime this afternoon to talk
further . ? please feel free to reach me if you have
any further questions in the mean time .
regards ,
