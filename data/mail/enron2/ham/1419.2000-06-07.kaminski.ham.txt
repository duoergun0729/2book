Subject: eol trade size discrepancies
vince -
i have discovered the two sources of discrepancy in the " transaction dollars "
on eol , between my numbers and those of eol . first , eol records all index
trades with the henry hub price ( since the index price isn ' t , inadvertently ,
recorded with the trade , as i told you ) , whereas i went back and appended the
contemporaneous index price to the trades . second , eol ignores all basis
trades in reporting transaction dollars , whereas i append a rough size to
them of the " price " as the basis , times the quantity .
i ' m sorry i wasn ' t ready in time with my numbers ; i took the task of accuracy
very seriously .
