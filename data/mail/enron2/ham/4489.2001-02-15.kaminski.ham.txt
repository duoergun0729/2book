Subject: avistar users and allocated charges
i have several queries re the avister charges for london , primarily because
the spreadsheet is based on a total of 24 london users . we have a total of
14 avistar users installed in london .
i believe the following london departments may have been charged for the
incorrect number of users :
fin  , l trading - $ 74 , 418 . 83 based on 4 units but have 5 users
rate & currency ( john greene not listed ? )
342 - 100467
softs mg - $ 42 , 857 . 23 based on 4 units but have only 1 user
1105 - 120415 ( nigel majury )
credit derivitives - $ 16 , 168 . 42 based on 2 units but none installed
0342 - 102843 ( 3 users on via video pilot )
liquids - $ 56 , 589 . 46 based on 7 units but only 6 installed
872 c - 104546 ( niamh clarke no longer based in london )
shankman london - $ 16 , 168 . 42 based on 2 units but none installed
0342 - 103058 ( brad hitch / merrill thomas no longer in dept . )
eel - exec - $ 8 , 084 . 21 based on 1 unit for john sherriff who is
0342 - 100309 on via video pilot - avistar not installed
legal london - $ 8 , 084 . 21 based on 1 unit for michael brown - avistar
0342 - 100348 not installed
london it - $ 16 , 168 . 42 based on two units but only one required
0342 - 100348 to administer system
the above figures are based on an original average $ 10 , 276 per seat .
however , a base change from 24 to 14 seats would increase the per seat charge
to $ 17 , 616 .
we also ought to look at charging out the isdn calls charges for the avistar
system ( in the region of $ 187 , 000 for 4 months ) .
