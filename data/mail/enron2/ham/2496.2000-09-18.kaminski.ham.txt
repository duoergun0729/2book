subject : update
vince ,
sorry i haven ' t been pressing you on the paper but there ' s always more to
do than we have time for . however , i had a phone call from the editor
encouraging me to get the paper to him by christmas so it could serve as
the centerpiece of his energy issue . his comment to me was " everyone wants
to know what enron ' s doing " . so , with that said i ' ll try to put together a
list of materials that i have collected and maybe we can have a phone
conversation to get your ideas on a plan to put the paper together . the
harvard cases do a nice job of laying out institutional and historical
details but we will need a " tack " or theme to begin the writing process .
by the way , we have managed to delay the spring texas finance festival one
week so that it will not coincide with easter ( hope you can now attend ) .
we didn ' t have too many problems with the easter weekend but there were
some and we would prefer not to use that weekend either .
hope all is going well for you guys . tell stinson hello for me .
your friend ,
john
