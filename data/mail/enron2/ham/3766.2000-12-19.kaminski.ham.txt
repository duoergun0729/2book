vince and jeff . . . the following is " fyi " . . . my assistant is working on the
flight arrangements . also , " fyi " , the doubletree and other downtown hotels
were entirely , or mostly , sold out , but my assistant found a good rate at the
warwick [ $ 115 ] by herman park , where everyone will be ' housed ' in the same
location for one night - - i also think this location is a good ' houston - sell ' .
dinner is scheduled for 7 thursday evening at churrasco ' s , and my group is
arranging the " tourenron " - - breaking this group into 2 . [ fyi : the energy club
from smu ( another skilling alma mater ) had long ago also schedule a tour that
day , so we ' ll have 19 from smu and 18 from wharton on the same day . . . but so
far , all seems manageable . ]
as " tour times " are set , and business unit interview requests are received
from the students , i ' ll keep you posted .
thanks !
