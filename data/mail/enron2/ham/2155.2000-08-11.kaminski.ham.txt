Subject: telephone interview with the houston research group
good morning quentin :
vince kaminski and the research group would like to conduct a telephone
interview with you sometime next week . considering the time difference
between
houston and australia , it probably makes sense to try and schedule it very
early in the morning your time , say 7 : 00 am ? it would be 5 : 00 pm here in
houston .
how does next wednesday or thursday , ( 8 / 16 or 8 / 17 ) at 7 : 00 am your time
sound ?
also , please let me know if you want to be reached at home or work .
thanks quentin and have a great day !
