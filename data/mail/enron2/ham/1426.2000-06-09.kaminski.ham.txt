Subject: ftr team ,
the copy of the auction results that you got at yesterday ' s meeting is
incorrect . what happened was when i tried to sort the entire page , i only
highlighted the related column and expected excel 98 would sort the whole
page . ( as steve told me before , i should highlight the whole thing if i try
to do sorting in excel ) . i appolized for the misleading and have redone the
whole thing . thanks for the patience . wish you all have a great weekend .
