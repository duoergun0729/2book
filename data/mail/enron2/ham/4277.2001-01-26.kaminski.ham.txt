mark lay : i shared confidentially with vince kaminski my developing
concept of a highly inefficient not - for - profit enterprise with
dramatically increasing costs . i believe that a for - profit economic
model is possible that should reverse these skyrocketing costs and
ultimately lower the commodity thereby having a national , if not , global
impact of health care costs . vince seems to also believe in the
concepts potential . the ceo of one of the biggest u . s . blood banks has
already asked to become involved . i would like involve more people
with vision , means and desire to help make this a reality . i would look
forward to meeting with you to talk further . al arfsten 713 965 2158
