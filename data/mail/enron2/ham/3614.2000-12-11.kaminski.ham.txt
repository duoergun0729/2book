george just " remembered " the traders ' meetings monday and wednesday
afternoons at 3 : 30 . he ' s going to email you - i think tuesday would ensure a
turnout of traders as well as analysts . we could easily have 20 people there
from power alone , and there ' s always gas . . . . when you decide the time , can
you ask shirley to reserve a conference room along the size of 30 cl ?
