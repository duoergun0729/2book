Subject: parking at 777 clay
hi louis :
we will have several employees from the london office coming to houston
this summer ( they will be rotating ) beginning 7 / 31 / 00 . can we get a parking
space at 777 clay for them ? we only need one for 7 / 31 / 00 - 11 / 30 / 00 ( 4
months ) .
the other alternative would be the stickers for allen center . do you still
have
them ?
please let me know .
thanks !
