subject : trip to houston
hi stinson , i am juan - carlos ferrer , also ph . d . student working with gabriel
bitran and going to houston with amit and paulo on the 16 th . paulo told me
that you are interested in some information of us before going to houston .
well , i am form chile , married , and father of two girls ( 3 and 2 ) . i
graduated from the engineering school at the catholic university of chile in
1995 having followed the track in computer science during the last 3 years of
school . then , late in 1995 , i was hired by the industrial engineering
department as a full - time assistant professor of management science , where i
was teaching and doing research until june 1997 . in august 1997 i came to
boston to join the operations management group in the sloan school of
management here at mit . i already finished courses and qualifiers
requirements of my program , so now i am trying to come up with an interesting
research topic to develop my ph . d . thesis .
i have been dealing with some interesting topics during the last months but
since enron appears as an opportunity to find a more challenging and
appealing problem to me i decided to explore it . my intention in going to
visit enron is to have a better understanding of the bandwidth business in
order to define a problem to work with . i would really like to do a thesis
that involves internet issues and yield management models , in the line of
amit ' s work .
any other information or question you need , please feel free to contact me .
looking forward to meeting you on the 16 th .
