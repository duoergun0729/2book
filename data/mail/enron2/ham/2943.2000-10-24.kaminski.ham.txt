Subject: 2000 projects
in order to better understand the research group , can i get a list of
projects that your group works on during 2000 ? were these projects budgeted
for separately in 2000 ? if the answer is yes , can we do a comparison
analysis on these projects ( actual vs plan ) ? based on the 2001 plan , i do
not think we budgeted by project , but i have to ask . . . if you have any
questions , please call me at 5 - 7094 . thanx .
