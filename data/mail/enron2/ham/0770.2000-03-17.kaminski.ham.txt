subject : thomas knudsen
hi vince
i met with thomas this morning ( i gave you his cv before , though i don ' t know
if you had time to read it ) . he ' s extremely interested in moving to enron ,
and accepts that our work is far less academic than his postdoc research ,
although far broader than his investment banking quant experience . he
remains interested , and emphasised he wants to stay close to the traders , but
wants to look at new markets and products . i think we should seriously
consider hiring him . he is ( understandably ) reluctant to move to houston ,
but there ' s no doubt that there is plenty of ( unnmet ) demand for derivatives
pricing ( and thinking ) here in london .
would you be interested in my setting up a videoconference in the next couple
of weeks so you have a chance to chat with him ? i ' m meeting with him again
on tuesday at an academic quant finance seminar organised by lane at king ' s
college . i ' ve attached his cv for your reference .
all the best ,
steve
