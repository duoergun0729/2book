Subject: re : real options
hi navroz
having presented my real options work at a recent conference , i think i can
see my way clear to producing a much reduced version ( 3 or 4 pages ) of my
" diagrammatic real options " paper . would risk still be interested in such a
shortened article ?

steven ,
after further consultation with the technical editor , we feel that your work
would find a more suitable environment for exposure in the journal of risk .
?
if you email a copy of your work ( to the editor - in - chief , philippe jorion )
and outline what has happened to :
?
? pjorion @ uci . edu
?
then i am sure that they will be keen to give due consideration .
?
thank you for your interest and sorry for the delay in coming to this
decision .
?
best wishes ,
?
