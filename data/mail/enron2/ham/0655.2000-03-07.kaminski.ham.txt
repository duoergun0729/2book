dear wincenty kaminski ,
today ' s focus : bug alert : welcome
by jason meserve
welcome to the security and bug patch alert newsletter !
given the recent spate of high - profile denial - of - service and hack
attacks and the large number of people who have signed up for this
newsletter before this first edition has been even published , it is
clear that security is a major concern in the it community as it
should be .
with technology now being looked upon as a profit rather than cost
center , it departments face more pressure to keep critical systems up
and running as well as secure . no chief information officer or network
manager wants to have to tell the ceo that their e - commerce site has
been broken into and customer credit card data copied . stories like that
tend to stick in a potential customer  , s mind more than an expensive
super bowl ad .
it  , s hard enough to keep up with the latest new technologies , never mind
latest security patch for your operating system or e - commerce
application . but we  , re here to help .
once a week we  , ll publish a list of patches and alerts from all the
major vendors and security organizations with links to the source . we  , ll
also provide other ( hopefully ) useful resources for the security -
conscious it manager .
comments and suggestions are always welcome ! send mail to
jmeserve @ nww . com .
now on with the latest patches and alerts :
