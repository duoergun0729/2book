Subject: re : american express charges
hi samer !
hope you had an enjoyable thanksgiving !
i found out the " scoop " on the ticket . it was non - refundable and non -
refundable tickets cannot be transferred . it was just your seat that
maureen ' s husband used .
i will send in a check request for reimbursement in the amount of $ 330 . 50 .
the best thing would be for you to go ahead and pay the bill or wait for
the check from us .
sorry for the confusion !
cheers !

subject : american express charges
shirley ,
how are you ? things are fine over here . we are still trying to settle in ;
this process seems to be taking forever .
i would like to ask for your help . i have received a statement from
american express related to my enron account . the charge amount is $ 330 . 50 ,
which is supposed to be for an airplane ticket . after calling the travel
agency in the park , i found out that this was the ticket that i was
supposed to have used to fly to colorado . however , the ticket was used by
maurine ' s husband and maurine claimed to have paid for the ticket . also , i
remember calling the tap and cancelling prior to the travel date . can you
help me figure out what is going on here ? i am not sure who is supposed to
pay for this . i disputed the charge before but my dispute was rejected .
i appreciate your help . thanks .
