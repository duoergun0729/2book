ashley ,
i agree with you . two trips are the best solution , unless of course shmuel
rearranges
the speaker list and the 16 th will work for the presentation as well .
coordinating so many different events is never easy . thanks for your
patience .

vince ,
actually , the general presentation that i have scheduled for the faculty club
( a dining / meeting room ) on campus is set for 7 : 00 p . m . - 9 : 00 p . m . on monday
the 16 th . i can attempt to change the presentation date again , however i
feel that it would be very unlikely that we are able to get another facility
that is near campus . at this point it may be better to plan on making two
seperate trips so that we are able to handle both events . maybe we could
combine another presentation in during the same visit . what do you think ?

shmuel ,
let ' s see if we can either rearrange the seminar speakers
or change the date of our visit to the campus . ashley baxter , our coordinator
is very efficient and
got a faculty room for a presentation on monday morning on the 16 th .

dear vince . i spoke too soon . apparently the seminar slot on the 16 was
already filled . i will see if i can switch the speaker for that week to the
following week . in any case we are on for dinner on the 16 .
