Subject: re : presentation
dawn ,
i met david sobotka from koch this morning and we talked about coordinating
our presentations .
this means there will be changes intended to avoid overlaps . sorry for that .
the portions of my presentation
will survive ( those about valuation paradigms ) and i shall add a few more
pages on accounting treatment of weather derivatives
plus more specific examples . david will cover primarily market evolution +
plus examples of some
standard structures , and we shall both give more interesting examples of
specific deals executed by our companies .
i shall send you an updated version of my part next week . let me know what
the deadline is .
