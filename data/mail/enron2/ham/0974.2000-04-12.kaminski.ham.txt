vince :
i am working now in ees as the chase national account manager and am
developing new products to sell chase . one of the products i am working on
integrates the provision of broad band with a package of computer
hardware and software for a company ' s employees .
i can explain more if you are interested .
i understand you put together a report on broadband which has helped educate
people as to the technology and economics . can i get a copy ? .
also do you have any analyses on chase that might help me detect other
opportunities ?
is there anyone on your staff with whom i should talk ?
thanks
chris
