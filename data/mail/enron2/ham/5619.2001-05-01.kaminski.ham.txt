Subject: re : london contact number
hi anita ,
how are you ? i arrived yesterday late morning from the london gatwick
airport . due to rush hour traffic , etc . it took a while to get into the city
to the hotel .
also , due to may day ( may lst ) protests / riots , etc . , the hotel management
strongly recommended that we remain in the hotel .
however , i am in the office today . i can be reached via email or via
telephone at 44 ( 0 ) 207 783 5647 .
take care ,
iris
