dear professor shreve ,
thank you for your message . i shall be glad to make a presentation at
carnegie mellon . i am discussing with pierre ste - marie possible dates and it
seems at this point that november the 3 rd would be the most convenient day .
november the 10 th is an alternative date , but i need a few more days to make
a commitment .
look forward to meeting you .
