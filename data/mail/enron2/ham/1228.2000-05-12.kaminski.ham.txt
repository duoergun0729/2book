nick ,
the airport is about 30 minutes by cab from the office ( 1400 smith ) .
the best hotel is either hyatt regency downtown or doubletree
downtown ( it is important to emphasize downtown when making
reservations ) . the hotels are within a walking distance
from the enron building .
we can make reservations for dinner around 6 : 30 - 7 : 00
in a resturant within 10 minutes by car from the hotel .
by the way , we shall be very glad to reimburse you for the trip related
expenses .

vince ,
yes , that would be ideal . but let me call first my travel agent to
see if there is a flight that would satisfy all the other
constraints . what time should i be at enron on thursday , and how far is
the airport from your offices ?
thanks ,
nick
