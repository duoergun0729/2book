Subject: re : eprm articles
chris ,
thanks for the invitation . the evening of july the 18 th is fine with me .
the list looks fine and it can be easily expanded , if the first set of
articles is well received . i shall prepare a list of topics that occupy us
every day and that we could write about without revealing the details of our
proprietary research .
please , feel free to send the message from lacima . i think that it ' s better
for us to sign the articles with our names , giving our respective
affiliations . in this way , enron gets the credit , but not the liability if
there is any error in an article .
hope to see you soon .
vince
