shirley ,
i just spoke with vince and asked him if he would be available to interview
one last candidate on monday . he said no problem that both he and stinson
would be available for interviews . could you please put on vince ' s schedule
one interview at 8 : 45 am - 9 : 15 am . stinson ' s interview will be from
9 : 30 am - 10 : 00 am .
i will just bring the candidate to their offices so they do not have to show
up early .
if you have any questions please feel free to contact me at extension 53214 .
thank you very much ,
kristin gandy
