jim ,
charm looks more like a prototype that requires a lot of work to make it more a
production tool .
we have developed a similar model ( without some nice functionalities charm has )
in about two weeks , at request of rick jones who joined ees from hsb . rick
worked on a similar model at his old company and wanted to have a similar tool
for his projects with enron . i can tell you more about it when we meet ( hopefully ) later
this week .
i would tell willis that the model requires more work before enron can
consider it as commercial product .
