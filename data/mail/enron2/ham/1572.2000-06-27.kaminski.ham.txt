grant ,
sorry for the silence . it ' s definately not a commentary on your work - i ' ve
been travelling back and forward between sydney and london like a yo - yo and
trying to tidy up things on our end . i ' ve been working on incoporating your
material and will spend all of tomorrow on this ( hopefully ! ) so that i can
ask for the last few amendments before the w / end .
many thanks and best regards .
chris .
