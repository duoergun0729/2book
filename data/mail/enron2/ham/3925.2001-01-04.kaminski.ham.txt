hello vince
i wanted to forward the following invitation to you . we are putting the
technologists through an orientation which includes a few days with the
analyst program - and the following is one of the events that they have
scheduled on jan . 16 th . i wanted to forward to you as more of an fyi since
we do not have any cal berkeley candidates starting on jan . 8 th . also - we
are starting to set some of the events on campus for the spring - so we
should probably get together soon . please let me know what works best for
you !
