Subject: copiers on 19
hi iain :
got a questions for you ? we have a small copier in our research area
( a minolta cspro ) that stays on the blink somewhere , quite a bit of the
time . the temporary copier in 19 kl is a kodak image source 50 . what
is the difference in price of these two copiers ? is there any way we could
exchange the minolta for the image source when you bring our permanent
copier to 19 kl ?
please let me know . we would like to do that if we can and it is not too much
more money .
thanks and have a great day !
