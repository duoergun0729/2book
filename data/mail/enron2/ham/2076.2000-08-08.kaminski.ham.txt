assume that ebs is responsible for 1 / 3 of the cost ( with taxes etc . must be
close to $ 15 , 000 ) .

subject : revised ilog quote 5 - 25 - 00
hi chonawee ,
you are right , i did make a mistake on the calculation , though it isn ' t
exactly 2 / 3 of the previous 3 pak quote . sorry about that and so glad you
caught it . i multiplied by 1 . 5 and i meant to use 1 . 3 . we have discounted
deployment paks which we discount by quantity . our chart starts with a 3
pak so i took that number from our price list and multiplied by 1 . 3 to get
14 , 560 . 00 . for 2 deployments , i take $ 4 , 500 for one , plus 10 % off for the
second license 4 , 050 , then times 1 . 3 = 11 , 115 . 00 . here is the revised
quote . i checked the other numbers again and they are correct . again , i am
sorry for the mistake .
regards ,
