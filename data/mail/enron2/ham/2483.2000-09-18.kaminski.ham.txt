subject : re : joint probabilities
the attached spreadsheet has been updated to include probabilities for
exceeding stated stock prices in each year .
these numbers represent the probability for all combinations of rab ratio and
exchange rate . for example , 2003 shows a stock value of 7 . 38 for a rab = 1 . 1
and fx = 1 . 5 . we previously showed the prob of exceeding a stock price of
7 . 38 , and rab > 1 . 1 , fx > 1 . 5 as 14 % . the probability of exceeding 7 . 38 for
all possible values of rab and fx is 35 % ( interpolating between 40 % and 27 %
in the price table ) .
