please note that the remaining videoconferences scheduled with enron have
been changed to teleconferences due to the difficulties we have experienced .
the host has agreed and we will , therefore , continue with teleconferences in
the same locations / dates as noted above .
any questions , please contact the fap office .
thanks ,
donna
