tom ,
i got sick and had to reschedule the meeting with nick bambos .
i shall meet him on saturday this week . i shall talk to him about the
following :
1 . financing research projects by graduate students ( $ 100 k per year , spread
over several projects )
2 . inviting nick to visit enron
3 . i can mention the possibility of nick consulting for us . given his status ,
involvement in the internet 2 project ,
and views that closely parallel enron ' s vision , it makes sense to have him
working for us . he could
be a very effective voice supporting our initiatives .
please , let me know what you think .
vince
