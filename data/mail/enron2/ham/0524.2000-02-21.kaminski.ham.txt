hi amy
a colleague of mine interviewed someone last week who is a phd whose
background is as a developer within catastrophe risk management . he is
looking to move into more of a quantitative role which will utilise his
developing skills and also his statistical and theoretical knowledge as
well . the issue is that he is based in chicago and i wondered if there
would be any interest from your headquarters there .
please find attached his details .
speak to you soon .
regards
simon
