subject : optical network engineering & enron research offsite meeting
hi john , as per our discussion and e - mails , i am suggesting the following
dates for the subject offsite : april 14 & 15 th ( friday & sat ) . place and
agenda to follow once this date is nailed up . the heads of each group will
decide who will attend . we would also invite kevin hannon , scott yeager , tom
gros , ted seitz and jean mrha once the dates and agenda are agreed upon by
the technical folks .
as before , the idea is to introduce the two of the most technical groups
within enron and to exchange ideas and issues . the enron research team will
provide trading and modeling presentations and the optical network
engineering team will present networking and components related topics .
take away from the two days will be to provide john griebling ' s group with
better understanding about how the trading markets have developed in general
and energy markets in particular via enron ( i . e . , how the sausage was
made ! ) . likewise , john ' s group will provide us with better understanding of
optical networking from a technical perspective . particularily , how ebs is
planning to develop the puplic switched optical network ( pson ) that john has
' branded ' our pooling point based network !
please reply asap if these two days ( april 14 & 15 ) will work . additionally ,
john , is the original suggestion to hold it in scott yeager ' s cabin somewhere
up in colorado mts . still holds ? if yes , i should probably let scott know !
if not , i ' ll try to find other places - - any suggestions , anyone ?
regards ,
ravi .
