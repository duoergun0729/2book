Subject: sap timesheets
hello everyone :
thanks to krishna we have come up with a plan that i believe is going to
save everyone some time . we have created an excel spreadsheet , with
the time sheet form , and there is a tab for each of you , in alphabetical
order
by first name across the bottom of the spreadsheet .
the spreadsheet is saved in o : \ research \ common \ sap timesheets \ mmm - dd .
( mmm = month and dd = 15 th or end of the month time period - i . e . , this time
period is 7 / 16 - 7 / 31 / 00 ) . the regular 8 hour days have already been entered
for each of you . therefore , if you have no exceptions you just need to type
in
your name in the bottom right corner by the place marked ( emp sign ) , and save
it .
if you do have exception time , simply open that particular pay period and
show the exception time ( off - duty , vacation , overtime , sick time , jury time ,
family
time , etc . ) that you may have had during that pay period . some of the codes
have already been entered for you , the rest are listed at the bottom of the
spreadsheet and just change the ones that are already there for whatever
applies .
if you are an exempt employee you need only show your off - duty time
or exception time . if you are non - exempt you must show all hours worked
and if you have overtime , you must add that to the 8 hours regular time .
there is no code for non - exempt overtime .
this should make it much easier for everyone . however , i will need you to
fill out this timesheet form by the 13 th and 29 th of each month . i will
try and remind you by email the day before .
i would still appreciate your emailing me of any vacation , hod day , or any
other
off - duty that you know about before hand , that way if you are out of pocket
for any
reason and cannot fill in one of the forms , i will be able to fill in your
timesheet for you .
if you have any questions or suggestions , please let me know .
thanks !
