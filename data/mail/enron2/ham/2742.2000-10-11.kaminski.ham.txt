the energy symposium is one of the largest energy conferences in the world and
we are successful in attracting senior energy executives as speakers to this
2 - day event . this year ' s event will be november 28 & 29 .
the energy symposium is much more that just an " accounting conference . "
industry leaders discuss a range of topics and share their perspectives on
strategic , economic , political , financial and operating issues .
participants find the networking aspect of the symposium to be especially
valuable . there is ample time during the event for them to meet and talk with
their counterparts and colleagues in the industry . and it is a premier
marketing opportunity for arthur andersen , where more than 300 partners and
managers get to spend two days with 700 executives from the energy and
utilities
industry in a forum .
the symposium check - in begins monday , november 27 at 6 p . m . , with a cocktail
reception in the galleria ballroom foyer . arthur andersen personnel are
encouraged to attend for an opportunity to network with colleagues , clients
and
prospective clients in an informal setting .
thank you in advance and i look forward to seeing you and your clients in
houston .
