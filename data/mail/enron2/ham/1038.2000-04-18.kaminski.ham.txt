Subject: marking chairs
hello all :
unfortunately , in the last two weeks we have had two of our research " chairs "
disappear from their location . we have reported this to security , but in all
likelihood they will be almost impossible to locate .
facilities has told us that they are not responsible for missing chairs and we
will have to order new ones . since they are very expensive , we have
decided to " mark " our chairs underneath the seat with a location or name .
sam is going to order some " silver or white " markers and we will begin
marking
each chair .
it is a shame we have to do this , but know of no other alternative . we will
let you
know when this will take place .
thanks !
