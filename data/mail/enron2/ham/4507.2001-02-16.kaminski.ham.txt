to discuss the webi contract . i ' ll also be meeting with wharton ' s broadband
( technical people ) before our meeting with the students . further , i hope to
meet with the people in charge of the business plan competition .
tom suggested you might want to call howard kurnreuther ( sp ? ) and possibly
stop in to see him while we are at wharton .
i ' ll be getting to wharton sometime tuesday ; i ' ll try to get a reservation at
the inn at penn . i ' ll then be leaving early wednesday morning by train to
new york .

in another $ 50 , 000 investment in efellows .

please note that the remaining videoconferences scheduled with enron have
been changed to teleconferences due to the difficulties we have experienced .
the host has agreed and we will , therefore , continue with teleconferences in
the same locations / dates as noted above .
any questions , please contact the fap office .
thanks ,
