Subject: re : mutually agreed upon changes okay
larry ,
i had a brief discussion with our lawyers . they are strongly advising us to
keep the changes we earlier incorporated , but to which you have not
assented . as this is a matter of company policy , unfortunately we do not
have much room to maneuver . if it would help you to have a direct
conversation with the lawyers to appreciate our company ' s perspective , i can
arrange for a phone call . please advise . thanks .
