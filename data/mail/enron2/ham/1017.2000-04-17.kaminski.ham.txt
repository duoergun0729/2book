Subject: thomas knudsen : interviews cancelled
dear all ,
i just got a call from thomas who wants to cancel the interviews scheduled
for today - he told me that he would call me at the beginning of may ( after
his holidays ) to arrange them . i did mention that there was a risk that the
position may be filled by then , but he seemed unperturbed by this .
regards ,
