hi anjam ,
i have quite a few questions / requests regarding the exotics libarary :
1 ) could you e - mail me instructions for building / compiling
s : \ research \ exotica \ excel \ exotica . xla
also if there is any more source code that i need please could you e - mail me
that .
you have all the code ( c & vba ) that makes up the library now - please see
previou e - mails
2 ) also could you e - mail me documents on the changes you have made to
s : \ research \ exotica \ excel \ exotica . xla
changes are documented through aterations to comments on individual source
code files as is the current method in houston and as adopted by me in
london - version control occurs at the individual file level rather than
through soiurce safe
3 ) the exotica . xla used in london and exotica . xll used in houston are quite
different . what regression testing has been done ?
how do we know if the two versions that we have been using produce the same
results .
i have not recently compared the xll from houston with our xla - this would
be a useful exercise for you
4 ) judging from the documentation there are quite a few more functions
available on the houston exotica
like asian spreads , quantos , digitals etc . is there any reason why they have
not been implemented in london ' s exotica . xla ?
maintenance and upgrades to london exotica to ensure compatability with
houston and vice versa is an on - going process - inevitably there will be some
lag between a new model being implemented in houston and in london , as is the
case with asian spreads and digitals . quantos are already available - see
vba code .
thanks in advance ,
sharad
