hi shirley ,
i would like to request for a new pc . my current pc is quite old with not
enough memory . twice
i ran out of memory and had to have it people coming to clean it for me .
their suggestion is
to either get a new hard drive or a new pc . given that dell has pentiumc iii
processor at 800 mhz
on market , i would like to request a pc with process at 500 mhz or higher
level .
thank you very much .
best ,
alex
