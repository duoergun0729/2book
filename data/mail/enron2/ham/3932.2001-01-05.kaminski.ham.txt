Subject: power plant model
jeff ,
a few comments on the model :
1 . we have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like
to
discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of
our insights to the consultant .
in general , the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the
details and in the inputs and
calibration . the same model may produce drastically different results
depending
on the quality of inputs .
2 . we don ' t have a separate pool of programmers in the research group . we
were told that you
would provide an it resource . alex would supervise this person .
