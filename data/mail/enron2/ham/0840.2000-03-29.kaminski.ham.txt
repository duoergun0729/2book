Subject: re : the research lunch
i would be very willing to make a presentation to you . this coming thursday
unfortunately , i have a sick day scheduled ( babies will do this kind of thing
to you ) and will not come into the office .
would it be more practical to make the presentation to a select group of a
few ( possibly ) interested individuals ? this might give us more shceduling
flexibility and would also seem more appropriate , knowing that what i have is
a set of suggestions for development and no earth - shuttering , live product .
please let me know if this accomodates your needs ,
yannis

yannis ,
shirley will know the room in which the lunch is scheduled . let her know
what audio - visual materials you ' ll need . keep in mind that the research group
is now about 40 people , some of whom will be watching the presentation on
video from portland and from london . the best platform would be to get a
pc - video or pc - screen link - up , so that everyone , including people watching
remotely , can see your computer ' s monitor on a big screen .
the itinerary for the lunch is that we meet at 11 : 30 and eat lunch and trade
news for the first 30 - 45 minutes , and then at 12 : 00 or 12 : 30 at the latest ,
we have a presentation . we try to wrap up by 1 : 00 , so that what we discussed
yesterday should make for a very good presentation in pretty much every way .
from my experience , the audio - visual people need at least an hour advance
warning to get the screens linked up . let me know if you need any help in
getting you and jenny the things you need .
joe
