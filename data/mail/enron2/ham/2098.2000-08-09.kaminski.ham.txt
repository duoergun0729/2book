nick ,
sorry for the delay in my reply . august the 21 st will work the best , since
jim fallon ( head trader for bandwidth ) will be out the following week . we
will set up a meeting with him . kevin hannon is out , however , and there is
no need for you to stay for dinner if you prefer to head back earlier in the
afternoon .
should you want help in making any travel arrangements , our assistant
shirley crenshaw ( 713 853 5290 ) would be happy to help you .
thanks and look forward to your visit ,
stinson
