hello vince ,
a colleague and i are hoping to have a panel discussion on energy
securities for the coming eastern finance association meetings ( april
25 - 28 , 2001 in charleston , south carolina ) . i was wondering if you or
someone you know at enron would be interested in participating in such a
meeting . i realize that you may not be able to plan this far in advance
and would certainly not be offended in the least if you cannot participate .
we already appreciate you taking time out of your schedule this past
semester to visit lsu .
i hope all is going well and wish you continued success in your ventures ,
tom arnold
