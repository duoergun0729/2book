hi vince ,
this resume looks quite good . we may wish to talk to him on the phone . however , now that david hoog has hired his own actuarial guys ( alex tartakowski and larry markus ) from ace , i am not sure if they require support on the actuarial side . with don black ( of global risk markets ) leaving enron , i think the effort to develop power products for the insurance markets is pretty much nonexistent , except for david hoog ' s product . the resume still looks interesting , though .

dear sir / madam ,
i am a student in a master ' s programme in mathematical finance due to graduate in august . my intention upon graduation is to work in a quantitative capacity in the
power markets and to this end , i am including my resume in the hope that i might be considered for any available position in your risk
management or structured products group requiring such mathematical skills .
i have addressed this email to your graduate programmes address but i am unsure whether or not my candidacy would fall under the umbrella covered by your associate programme . if this is not the case , any help in seeing that my resume finds the correct destination would be greatly appreciated .
yours sincerely ,
ian mccracken
