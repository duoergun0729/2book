Subject: my students
dear vincent ,
i spoke with my students yesterday and they told me they have thought
about coming to see you again , and they think it ' ll be much better in
the future when they are closer to completion of their ph . d . i think this
is a very sound idea , but i wanted to give them anyway the opportunity
to see the actual working environment at a place like enron . they are both
very serious and responsible , so they feel they had better go see you when
they would be in a better disposition to give more of themselves to enron .
they are both superb students and very hard working individuals , so i do
hope you will consider checking them out in the future ( within a year -
year and a half ) .
i will contact you and / or stinson in the future when they are closer
to finishing up .
best ,
carlos
