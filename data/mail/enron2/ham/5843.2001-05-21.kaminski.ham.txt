Subject: d - g energy software procurement
laine ,
enclosed is a revised copy of the software licence agreement with d - g energy . the earlier version had prices and conditions of use which differed from what had been discussed over the telephone . this version brings into line the terms with what has been agreed upon , and has been given tentative approval by the president of d - g , who i met with last week .
i have highlighed the sections which have changed from the version that you sent out for signature last november .
i assume that the revised document will have to be reviewed by legal again . let me know if i can be of any assistance in this process .
regards ,
