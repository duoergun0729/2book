Subject: energy book
hi vince ,
i have pulled a list of names together that i would like to send some
samples of our chapters of the book too , in the next couple of days , in
order to try and get one or two sentence " reviews " for the dust jacket of
the book . i obviously won ' t say anything about enron ' s sponsorship until it
is official sorted out , but is it ok if i indicate that yourself and grant
are contributing material to the book ?
i ' m proposing to send 5 or 6 chapters to the following - unless you have
any objections or suggestions ?
david shimko
ehud ronn
helyette geman
mark garman
dragana pilipovic
corwin joy
ilia bouchouev
alexander edyleland
steve thomas
hope the writing is going ok , and regards to grant .
best regards .
