1 . paul johnson said that monday night would be fine for the dinner with
spyros .

boston conference by this evening in order to have copies made . i told
her
you were in meetings and had been very busy , i did not know whether your
presentation was ready or not . we can have 500 copies made from the
copy center and overnight them to her next week , but you won ' t be here on
the 9 th to do this . do you have any suggestions ?
