Subject: 1 candidate and 2 interns
hi vince and molly .
here attached is one candidate who is particularly interested in having his
profile sent to vince . . . he is going to be traveling to ny from the uk soon
for 2 wks .
he specifically asked my partner at robertwalters in the uk to investigate
enron through my new relationship with you guys . he would be howard haughton ,
attached below ( cv ) .
the other 2 resumes are my students at the university of michigan . howard lin
received a 4 . 0 / 4 . 0 for his last term and will be willing to do whatever it
takes to intern at enron for june - aug . i have his picture included as well .
the second is sung , they are friends . howy will be done expected in may 2001
and sung in may 2002 . they are my favorite interns and i expect they can be
cultivated to the enron culture with no real cost to you ( a " test drive
before committal . i have agreed to represent them and
shall take ownership , as they become graduate candidates upon their degree
completion .
i hope these attachment can represent my value and commitment to quality of
talent to enron .
thank you for your acceptance .
best wishes for the weekend .
