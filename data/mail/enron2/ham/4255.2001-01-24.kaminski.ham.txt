with regard to anshuman and there was some noise in the system .

skilling ) ,
i shall choose neil .

vince : apparently neil mcgregor became upset when he received margaret
daffin ' s email . he is saying , however , that anshuman will only be in
houston for one month , and you had mentioned six months when we spoke
earlier . it really doesn ' t make any difference since he will need to get an
ll visa under either circumstance , but i thought you might want to see his
email .
