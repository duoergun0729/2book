subject : fw : research allocations to egm
back in november of last year , you have indicated that 40 % of the 17 . 5 % ( 40 %
of 17 . 5 is 7 % ) that we are allocating to egm should be billed to gary
hickson ' s group . gary is asking for further broken down of this 40 % to his
world . can you check with vince to see what portion of the 7 % should be
charged to equity trading , rate & currency trading , agricultural trading &
origination and convertible trading ? and can i get this information back by
the end of this week because we are going to start closing on friday . if you
have any questions , call me . thanx .

becky ,
i gave the % % for egm to shirley . i assume she communicated this info to you
already .
i assume egm includes f / x - i / r ( gary hickerson ) , weather , insurance ( jere
overdyke ) ,
oil trading and coal .
for calme i don ' t have any info . let ' s split the cost evenly .

shirley ,
grm is now with egm group . egm wants to verify that the 17 . 5 % we are going
to allocate to grm is for the insurance , jere overdyke group . egm seems to
think that their weather , mark tawney group , is receiving support from
research . also , can we break out the support for calme ? calme is going to
split into 3 bus and i am trying to determine who i need to bill for research
supports . if you have any questions , call me . thanx .
