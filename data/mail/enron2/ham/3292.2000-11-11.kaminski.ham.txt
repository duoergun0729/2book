rick and ted ,
it looks more like foxes building chicken houses as opposed to foxes guarding
chicken houses .
i shall send a message to bryan saying that the research has to look under
the hood and examine the mechanics
of the model in order to sign off on it . a dog and pony show is not
sufficient . in any case , the decision to approve
the model should not be left to ben and kirstee .
please , let me know what your thinking is .
vince

vince / steve - - we are going to the board in december to ask for formal
limits . as you know one of the key limits at the board level is value at
risk . to that end , it is imperative that you are comfortable with our
approach for calculating var . we have implemented a third party risk system
which holds all of our positions and are in the process of putting the debt
positions in . the system has a var engine which is being demo ' d by the
vendor today . ben and kirstee are attending the demo and if they find the
technology acceptable , i propose moving forward with implemantion of the
module . pls . let me know if this sounds reasonable and how you would
envision implementing .
thanks
