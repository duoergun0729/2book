Subject: re : hdaf seminar topics
folks :
i have tentatively set the date for our first round - table discussion for
wednesday ,
december 20 th at 3 : 00 pm - 4 : 30 pm . the room , eb 3268 , will be available from
3 : 00 to 5 : 00 pm . if any of you have an issue with the date , please let me
know by
day ' s end .
professor don kouri of the physics department of the university of houston
will start
with an informal 30 - 45 minute presentation ( see appended abstract below ) of
his work
and will then lead a discussion as well answer questions that we may have .
professor kouri , please let me know if you have any requirements for
audiovisual
or other equipment .
this excerpt from a previous correspondence provides an insight to the
subject of our meeting :
[ . . . ] topics to
be discussed at a small ` ` roundtable ' ' format meeting , are :
1 . hdafs for data analysis , including ` ` gap - filling ' ' , data
extrapolation , denoising , mathematical manipulations of digital
data ( e . g . , taking derivatives , applying functions of differential
operators to digital data , etc . )
2 . hdafs as the basis of numerical algorithms for solving nonlinear
partial differential equations , particularly for equations for which
existing methods encounter stability problems .
there are certainly other areas of interest and applications of the
hdafs but i think that even trying to do both of the above in a
single meeting would be difficult . of course , in this first meeting
we would focus on general aspects of the hdafs that make them robust
for such applications . if , however , you have other topics in which
you are interested , i am willing to focus on them .

subject : hdaf seminar topics
folks :
i am trying to set up a meeting with professor don kouri of the university of
houston and i believe you may have an interest in the topic of discussion .
if you know of other interested parties , or want to substitute a proxy for
yourselves , please let me know .
this first meeting with dr . kouri will introduce the participants to his area
of research ( hdafs for data analysis ) and allow us to define the contents and
attendants of a seminar ( to come up soon ) .
we are looking to hold this discussion this week ( hopefully ) and to have the
seminar happen before christmas ( given that this is the in - between semester
season for schools ) .
a couple of other similar meetings will follow up : dr kevin bassler will be
talking about microscopic simulation of economic markets and dr . pinsky about
the effect of solar phenomena on the earth ' s atmosphere .
