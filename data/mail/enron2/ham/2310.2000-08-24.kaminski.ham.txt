dear vince .
i sent you a reply earlier this month but i haven ' t heard from you about the
date of your visit . our department has a seminar every monday . if you can
schedule your visit on a monday i would like to invite you to give a seminar
which will be attended by many of our graduate students and faculty and will
give you an opportunity to tell them about your program . with sufficient
lead - time i can advertise the seminar in the hass school to their financial
