presumably if the eastern credit reserve issues take lots of his time away
from enroncredit , we could extend his stay for another week ? especially as
it ' s unlikely we could get vasant over in the foreseeable future .

bryan ,
just fyi - amitava will be diverted for an unspecified portion of his stay
here next week .
the did the initial coding for software / pricing systems used to value the
eastern deal . there are over - riding concerns there i or steve l . can fill
you in on if you like . problem could be monday morning or all week .
we could press for vasant to re - prioritize his time .
any thoughts ? i haven ' t checked with ben about impacts yet . . .
ben ?
