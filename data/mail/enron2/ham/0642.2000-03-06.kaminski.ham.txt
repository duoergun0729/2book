april :
paulo is the mit ph . d . student who talked with you by phone a couple of weeks
ago . he is interested in trying to better define what type of project he
might do over the summer with ebs . recall that he is interested in the
psychological / customer behavior issues related to web commerce as compared to
traditional commerce . perhaps the easiest way to proceed would be for you ,
me , ravi , and vince to get together to discuss possibilities . we could then
include paulo by phone to get his initial reactions / suggestions . after an
initial assessment , we could then plan on another visit for paulo .
please let me know what your schedule would allow .
thanks ,
