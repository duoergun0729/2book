> dr . kaminski ,

> i attended your var course in sydney in july , but when i went back to look
at the notes recently i found that i am missing some sections ( e . g . optimal
techniques for measuring var , using monte carlo techniques to accurately
calculate var , evaluating the impact of volatility and extreme values on
var ) . would you be able to send me a copy of your notes , as i am about to
embark on a var modelling exercise and i am sure they would be very useful .
