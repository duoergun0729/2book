sandeep : further to my voice mail to you today , i will meet with anshuman at
10 : 30 am and will keep his documents in a file .
however , without some type of job offer in the us , we cannot move forward
with an ll visa for him and if you believe he will not be returning to the us
to work , then we really do not need to get him the ll at this time .
if the circumstances change , please let me know .
