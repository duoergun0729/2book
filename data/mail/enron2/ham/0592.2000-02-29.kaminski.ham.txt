Subject: re : fw : stanford or - summer intern
this guy has basic quant skills , etc . but at ebs we would need interns
possible from mba schools , not phd . i think he is a summer intern fit for
enron research and we can loop him into ebs research as we need help ( which
is likely ) .

stinson ,
should we get him as well ?
it seems he has the right skills .
we might have maxed out on the
number of summer interns through
the a / a program . we would have to
hire him directly .
