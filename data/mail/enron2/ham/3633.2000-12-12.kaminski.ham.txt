vince , zimin ,
i participated in a telephone conference on this company this morning . there
was a possibility enron would invest in it .
their product appears to be a gui interface over the top of ilog solver ( and
possibly ilog cplex ) which allows problems to be expressed in high level
terms . i do not see any immediate application at enron , but i am interested
in the concepts used so expressed an interest in a demo . maybe it would be
useful for general modelling projects here .
they do not even have a user manual for their software , so it will be
difficult to figure out what it does unless a demo is arranged . the
possibility for growth in the company seems small as the ilog software is a
modest size market and their product is aimed at only a small part of that
market . i think the scheduling tools in sap , i 2 , etc are more likely to
succeed than this one as they are already integrated into an information
system .
because of the small market for this software , the many competitors , the
absence of any clear use for it at enron and the early stage of development ,
there is very little prospect of us funding this company .
