Subject: re : new copier information for 55 , 60 & 65 cpm digital machines
iain :
we went and looked at the toshiba copier on the 32 nd floor and while it
does not appear to be extremely fast , i believe it will work for the 19 th
floor . i spoke with vince kaminski and he agreed with our getting this
copier .
we noticed this copier has a button that says " network connection "
and were wondering it this copier could be hooked up to the network and
we could run copies from our computer ? please let us know .
thanks for all your help and have a wonderful christmas and new
year !

shirley ,
following up on the telephone conversation , please see the attached
spreadsheet for pricing information plus important information about " true
world " copy speeds .
pricing was centered on the 42 . 315 k per month volume band so that you can get
a good feel for copier expenditure based on average month volumes . i have
left the spreadsheet " unprotected " so that you can play with the volume
figures and see how this changes the price overall + how the " cost per image "
is affected by volume changes .
? pricing spreadsheet : under " notes " towards under the pictures .
the " true world " copy speed information has been supplied by buyers lab
incorporated , which is an independent testing house that rates office
equipment , including copiers and publishes their findings on a quarterly
basis . unfortunately they have not released their findings on the canon ir 550
as testing is not yet complete .
? copier speeds : @ the end of the notes - mail
{ these include 1 - 1 , 1 - 2 and duplexing + detail on completion of " sets " }
as you will see , duplexing speeds are widely different across the various
manufacturers equipment & the " true world " copy speeds are a soft $ expense
which impacts the true cost of running a copier .
listed below are the url ' s for the different 55 , 60 & 65 cpm b / w copiers .

fyi : we currently have a toshiba 6570 @ eb 32 kl that is averaging 69 , 332
images per month with the top month producing 86 , 673 images and a toshiba
5570 @ eb 3080 area that is averaging 39 , 309 per month . both of these machines
are in the enron north america trading environment .
the copiers quoted are all " digital " .
digital : scan once print many = 99 copies of one sheet ? 1 scan !
analog : scan for every image made = 99 copies of 1 sheet ? 99 scans = possible
noise issue .
copier speeds = total print time
this comparison gives the speed @ which the document set is printed
{ no staple , no 3 - hole punch }
