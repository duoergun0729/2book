vince : mark had not received my email so simply assumed that i had a
business plan and he would help if he could . i explained that i was at
the " pre " business plan stage . further , that i had hoped to discuss my
search for collaborators to become co - founders . people with vision that
might help develop and refine the concept , identify model components ,
isolate modules for the initial effort and build a business plan
suitable for angel investors not vcs . i might need your help in
conveying this to him . i have struggled to put on paper a very rough
draft of how it might be best describe as to the direction it might go
and what might conceptually be possible . please look at this and tell
me if i am going too far at this point . i do not want to implant
insurmountable obstacle in anyone ' s mind . i hope to hear from you . al
