subject : sacramento weather station
hey guys ,
we ' re talking to a contractor ( s ) that can build us a weather station
( hopefully very quickly ) for placement in sacramento , california . for a
variety of legal , contractor , and operational reasons , i need to confirm some
of the following requirements as soon as possible so we can proceed :
a ) you need rainfall , snowfall , and temperature measurement from one ,
high - accuracy commercially available weather station .
b ) you need a daily feed of this data to enron ' s weather desk : does this
mean one data dump at a set time per day ? alternatively , will you need to
check the data real - time , perhaps at varying and multiple times during the
day ?
c ) we will be installing this station near sacramento , california : we will
need to know exactly what areas in / near sacramento are suitable for the site
of the weather station . ( what again was the name of the town that you
mentioned mark ? ) in the interest of time , i recommend that your weather
expert accompany our landman to select the site , which will allow our landman
to more quickly lease and install the station .
d ) you desire to have some independent security measures to deter or detect
tampering . i suggest given the very short time fuse , that we first install
the station and then develop security measures .
e ) we will feed the data directly to the enron weather desk . will any other
parties require real - time access to this data ?
please forward responses directly to : chris clark / na / enron and myself .
thanks , scott
