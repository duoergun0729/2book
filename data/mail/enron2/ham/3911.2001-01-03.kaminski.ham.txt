Subject: friday brown bag lunch on option pricing
zimin ,
i have talked to alex about it . i don ' t think that the additional seminars
will
crowd out the brown bag lunches .
the seminars are really targeted to people who recently joined the group and
have very limited , or zero , exposure to energy markets .
for most members of the group it should be the piece of cake . brown bag
lunches
are not that time intensive , except for the speaker .
plus , we ran out of days available for lunch meetings .

subject : friday brown bag lunch on option pricing
vince ,
this is a brief summary of last year ' s friday brown bag lunch option pricing
series .
we had about 15 lectures , given by the following people :
grant , stinston , vasant , krishna , zimin , maureen , clayton , paulo , chonawee ,
myself , and
some outside speakers . we were able to attract some outside audience as well .
overall the response is quite encouraging and we have planned
to continue it .
in light of the presently scheduled seminars on " energy derivatives " , it
seems our friday
schedule will be too crowded if we have seminars on " energy derivatives " on
two fridays
and fbblop on other fridays . what ' s your suggestion ? should we discontinue
the fbblop ?
we also have scheduled january 19 for tom halliburton ' s visitor leon lasdon
from ut austin
to talk on non - linear programming . should we cancel it ?
best ,
zimin & alex
