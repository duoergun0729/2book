Subject: re : best wishes for the holiday period
ehud ,
best holiday wishes to you and your family .
i owe you an apology for dropping the ball on the conference
i have approached a number of executives at enron . greg whalley speaks in
london a day
before . louise kitchen , the mother of enrononline will ski ( this is the week
of school holidays in england and her family will come here ) .
one suggestion i want to make is rick causey . i talked to him and he is
willing to
be a speaker . he is a very senior and important executive of enron and a ut
grad .
any thoughts ?
