Subject: working paper list & etc
dear vince :
i have put together a list of finance working papers ( some of which i brought to the interview last wednesday ) which i have written since 1995 mostly in support of my work but also ( at least initially ) as a learning tool . several of them , however , do contain innovations .
i have asked ms . de claris to forward a copy to you .
as i expressed to you earlier i am particularly interested in enron credit swaps trading platform and the business opportunities that it will spawn .
i also think that there are tremendous opportunities to be explored in the secondary mortgage maket in the us . i do not know if enron has considered or is active in this market . this would be an area that i am also very interested and in which i think much better can be done than most of the players in the street .
the question in my mind ( hopefully not prematurely ) is : if there is interest here would enron consider letting me put together this business ?
i look forward to hearing from you soon .
best regards
joao
