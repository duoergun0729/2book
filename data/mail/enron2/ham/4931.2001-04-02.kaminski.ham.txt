hi iris
i have two different hats to wear in talking to enron . one is as a
financial economist . the other as the director of the newly formed " global
mobility innovation initiative ( gmii ) - - this is the research project
funded by lucent , involving bu , lbs , and insead , to study various aspects
of the mobile internet ( read 3 g ) .
on the former i am working with a couple of ph . d . students in understanding
( a ) details of how having physical supply ( inventory ) can be used by a
market maker . this is a problem that has been studies in the context of
specialists inventory in the stock market but i think really interesting in
the way enron does it in some of the newer markets like bandwidth . i
think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber that is in the
ground .
( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with
market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that
most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them
and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting ,
asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options
valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron ' s
real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate
these problems by imposing a market disciplining .
( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials ,
credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have
options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the
story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets
enron has been moving into over the last few years .
on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when
you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am
working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be
wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room .
i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss
some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the
room would be very important to me .
as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 ,
may 3 / 4 are good for me .
regards
nalin
