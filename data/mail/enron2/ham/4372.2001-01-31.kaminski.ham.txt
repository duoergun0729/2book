hi john and vince !
john , hopefully you received my voice mail regarding the matter set forth
below .
i ' m in ny now and won ' t return until thursday morning . perhaps it would be
easiest for john to come to the video conference on thursday ( if he ' s in
houston ) or via telephone if he ' s travelling ? ?
whatever you both think is best . . please let me know !
my assistant , melinda mccarty , is setting up the call location at the enron
building , as well as the dial - in number with donna piazze at wharton .
melinda , please include john in the distribution of the video conference
location .
thanks !

christie ,
as we talked last thursday via video teleconference , we are planning to
narrow our scope to focus on a marketing / promotion plan for newpower
including value - added products and services for the future . before we talk
again on thursday , we would like to speak with john henderson again to see if
he recommends any specific items he would like us to address .
we are having trouble contacting him and wonder if you could facilitate a
phone meeting between us , or if it would be best to include him in our next
video teleconference . we are available the next two days at lpm and 4 pm
houston time .
we understand that john is a very busy person , and we appreciate any help you
can give in getting us together to ensure our work is commensurate with his
expectations .
thanks ,
enron team 3 ( retail )
