Subject: floating lng terminal
folks ,
as a follow - up to scott neal ' s inquiry this morning concerning
portable / floating lng opportunities for california , i have learned that no
such capability currently exists .
according to todd peterson of enron global lng , exploitation of this
opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one , as far
as we know , has
constructed such a vessel .
i did come across a proposed design for an lng floating terminal by the
italian company , tecnomare . i contacted them and they indicated that they
have not
built such a vessel . it is estimated that construction of such a vessel
would take 2 - 3 years , and as one might imagine , achieving the required
operational and
environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial .
attached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vessel ,
please let me know if any further research is needed .
