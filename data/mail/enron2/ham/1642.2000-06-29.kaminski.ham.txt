subject : mike catanese ' s resume
i am a ph . d . physicist and have worked for the last five years in
post - doctoral researcher positions in astrophysics . a few months ago , i
realized that i had reached the limit of my academic career options , at least
for the near future . after reading about careers in the private sector and
discussing possibilities with some family members and friends , it became
apparent that my technical and mathematical skills could be transferred to
the private sector , with better long - term career options and a more dynamic
workplace environment than in academic research . the energy industry is
particularly attractive as it begins to deregulate . i have been directed to
enron by several different people as a very forward - thinking and growing
company and one which values its employees .
because of my statistical and mathematical skills , i am interested in a
position as a quantitative analyst . however , if there are other areas where
the people at enron think i could contribute , i am open to other options . my
other experience , such as project management , is outlined in my resume . i
have worked in a collaboration of 30 astrophysicists from the us , ireland ,
and england and i am a capable independent worker as well . i have excellent
written and oral communication skills and have made presentations to
audiences ranging from technical experts to school - aged children .
thank you again for your time and effort in passing this resume on . i look
forward to talking with you .
sincerely ,
mike catanese
