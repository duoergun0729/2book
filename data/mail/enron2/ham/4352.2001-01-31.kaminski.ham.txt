Subject: re : livelink
moyez ,
we are very anxious to get set up and start using livelink for tracking and
documenting our projects , so thanks for the reminder . i have put together
an initial list of attributes for our research projects . the list in in the
attached spreadsheet . it would be great if you can set up these attributes
for us in the test environment . this would allow us to make any obvious
changes before moving to production . let me know what your schedule would
be in rolling this out .
my brief comments in the spreadsheet may not be clear , so feel free to give
me a call at x 34748 to clarify anything .
again , thanks for your help .
