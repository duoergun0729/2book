Subject: re : fw : pserc nuggets related to market stem
hi vince and happy new year
good to hear from you and i can understand being busy . i am myself trying to
balance my commitments here .
like any research consortium pserc is trying to provide value to its members
while walking the fine line between cooperation and competition . we are
definitely not in the business of providing proprietary research to the
members but rather working on more generic areas that later individual
members could see way to convert to proprietary tools . the work that shijie
deng and rajnish kamat have been doing with me are good examples .
as to my trip , thanks for the invitation but i already committed myself to
get back friday night so i will save my visit for another time .
i will tell my son about the spring interviews at cornell . hopefully this
time he will not miss it .
regards , shmuel
