the " inter _ regional links . ppt " file shows the topology and links between
bubbles in the our model and " expand _ india _ data _ 011000 . xls " details the
existing station information that we have compiled to date . ? total resources
closely match reported resources as shown in " l & r _ 0110 . xls " . reported india
total in 1997 is 86 , 000 mw and that in the henwood database is 84 , 000 mw
