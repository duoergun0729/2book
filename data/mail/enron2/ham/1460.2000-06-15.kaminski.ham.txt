following the recent lunch presentations , there has been considerable
interest from enron europe staff in improving their quantitative skills ,
helping to maintain our competitive advantage over competitors . we have

enron europe home page under london research group . the site contains an
introduction to the group and also information on :

hedging and risk management of derivatives ) please don ' t hesitate to get in
