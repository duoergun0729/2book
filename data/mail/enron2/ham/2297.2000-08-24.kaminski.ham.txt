subject : uk rab multiples
i talked with keith harris , our cfo at wessex , about the rab multiple graph i
gave you . he expressed that the wessex people had originated the data and
that the graph was correct , to the best of their knowledge . the only ( but
very important correction ) is that they started the graph at an index of
100 % , which does not imply a 100 % of rab multiple . rather , the initial rab
multiple was around 80 % , implying that the entire line should be taken down
by 20 percentile points . thus the all time hime in late 98 should be closer
to the 1 . 3 x rab that i had targeted during our discussion . please call keith
if he has not yet contact you .
