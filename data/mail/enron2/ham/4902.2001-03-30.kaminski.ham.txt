mike ,
we have decided to go ahead with the purchase of a single license of imsl
libraries ( c / c + + ) for pc . i believe that would be cnl 4 . 0 forpc . let me
check the cost for the license before we finalize it as i have mislaid your
previous e - mail about the cost . it is my recollection that it is less than
$ 1500 . please e - mail to confirm with the precise number so we can proceed
wih that .
thanks ,
rakesh

rakesh ,
as we discussed , the cnl 4 . 0 pc libraries are not license managed . version
5 will be . the pc version 4 . 0 can be installed on a network drive and
called from networked pcs . as expected , we would ask that enron honor the
license agreement by allowing only the number of simultaneous uses
permitted
by the license . version 5 . 0 will be license managed and can be licensed as
node locked or floating .
with regard to unix licensing , the current version of cnl for unix is
license managed . it can be licensed as node locked or floating . if you
install the libraries on a unix server as node locked , the number of
simultaneous sessions on that server is not limited except by the
capabilities of the machine . a floating unix license would be checked out
by the individual user to be executed on a local machine .
also as mentioned , your investment is protected by allowing you to upgrade
in the future by paying only the price difference between your current and
desired platforms . this upgrade option only applies to licenses covered
under support .
if you have any additional questions , please let me know . i look forward
to
providing you the best math and statistical libraries available today to
help you solve your problems and understand your data .
best regards ,
