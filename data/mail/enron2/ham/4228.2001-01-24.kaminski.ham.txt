subject : next step
vince : your suggestion to introduce the concept discussed with one of
the lays is welcomed . i hope that this would mean that you would remain
involved at some level . the design of the model and its potential
economics could be key to how worthy the effort might be . enron could
be an ideal environment from which to the concept enhancement through to
commercialization could be successfully accomplished . please
confidentially share matters as you think best and advise me of the
interest generated . i am ready to meet there at your building or
elsewhere that is appropriate . best regards , al arfsten 713 965 2158
