colleen ,
after looking into the transport deals for nbpl ( long term deal 1 , 2 , 25 , 26 ) ,
i think i figured it out why
we see positive fuel p / l for deal 1 , 25 , and 26 and negative fuel p / l for deal
2 .
the following plot shows nymex curve as of 8 / 23 / 00 :
for short term , nymex moved up compared to that of 8 / 22 / 00 , while the long
term nymex moved down .
here are the tenor for each deal :
deal 1 : start 01 - sep - 00 , end 22 - may - 09 , the above graph suggested a
positve fuel p / l
deal 2 : start 01 - sep - 00 , end 28 - feb - 02 , the above graph suggested a
small negative p / l
deal 25 : start 01 - may - 02 , end 28 - feb - 09 , the above graph suggested a
positve fuel p / l
deal 26 : start 01 - mar - 09 , end 31 - may - 09 , the above graph suggested a
positve fuel p / l
the transport book seems to be correct on these fuel p / ls .
another point worth to mention is that the fuel cost is related to index
price ( nymex + basis + index premium ) , to correctly interpret fuel p / l ,
we need to look at the index curve change .
let me know your thoughts on this .
