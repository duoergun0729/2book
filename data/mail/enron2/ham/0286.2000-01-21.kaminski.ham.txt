Subject: energy derivatives book
hi vince ,
it was good to speak to you and grant the other day . plese find attached a
block of 3 chapters that are basically the middle of the book . this should
give you an idea at the level it is pitched - although these are probably
some of the the most technical of the chapters . julie who works for us will
be getting in contact with you soon to chase you up on your chapter !
i ' ve asked julie to have a chat to you about a couple of other things at
the same time . i hope this is ok with you . julie and i will be making a
trip thru houston around the third week of february to try and visit some
energy companies . it ' s mainly a fact finding trip to see what the energy
companies are doing and how we might be able to make use of our skills in a
commercial sense . would you recommend any people we should talk too ? also
we will be running a course on energy derivatives in houston at the end of
march following the success of the course in new york last year and want to
advertise this . do you know of people who would be interested in such a
course ?
we are currently putting together promotional material for the book - can
you please let julie know how you and grant would like to be advertised -
your official positions , etc .
best regards , and i look forward to reading your chapter soon .
chris .
