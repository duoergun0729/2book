Subject: departure
the research group is a unique and extraordinarily valuable organization for
enron . the success of the group has led to widespread recognition of enron ' s
leadership in quantitative finance as it relates to the energy markets .
therefore , it is with great mixed emotions that i announce my resignation as
i move on to the next phase of my career .
i have enjoyed getting to work with each of you and wish you continued
success for the future .
highest regards ,
kevin kindall

meeting .
