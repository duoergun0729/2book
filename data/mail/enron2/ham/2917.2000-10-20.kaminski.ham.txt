Subject: offer to rakish ( sp ? )
vince ,
norma called and said that rakish had requested stock options instead of a
signing bonus . she suggested giving $ 30 k worth of options which would vest
over a 3 year period , and i told her that i am sure this would be fine with
you . it should cost us less than the offered cash bonus of $ 20 k .
