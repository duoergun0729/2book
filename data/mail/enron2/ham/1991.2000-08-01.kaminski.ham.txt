history in nominal terms
for a us onshore louisiana natural gas price ( or a texas wellhead price ) and
a uk landed beach price for the past 15 years ? i am gathering historical data
for jim o hara for our colombia pipeline in south america and these are among
the series of data they are seeking . they would like the data
from a published source in an electronic file if possible . . their timetable
is by cob weds this week . thank you for your help . margaret
mike do you agree with me ? please , ask elena to check what price info is
available at xmim .

margaret ,
the prices going back 15 years are not too informative ( for the first 5
years ) , as he industry was still regulated .
we shall try to get you the us series as soon as possible .
