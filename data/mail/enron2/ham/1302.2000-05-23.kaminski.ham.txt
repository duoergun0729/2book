mr . roberts ,
i am glad we were able to reach a practical solution for you without going
too much against the grain of enron corp . ' s it policy and standards .
thanks to david wile and mark hall in formulating a solution that addresses
everyone ' s needs .
in summary ,
your contingency and recovery machine ( laptop ) will be imaged for win 2000
applications will be evaluated for compatibility
this will allow you to use the machine as a back - up to gather weather data
off the internet ( via independent dial - out line ) in case the normal enron
network architecture is unavailable .
i will follow - up to make sure we capture the one exception to the policy and
standard that surfaced ( local admin rights on the laptop for development
activity ) . irm / roberto deleon will facilitate with a risk acceptance request
form .
thanks again ,

what i have :
a . i have an ibm thinkpad and a cd for windows 98
b . i got the ibm from richard weeks . i bought the windows 98 .
c . i have a valid business need to get windows 98 on the ibm
a . my job requires a totally independent backup to access data off the
internet and process same for trader ' s report
b . this must be done 7 days per week in the early am .
c . i have new equipment that doesn ' t run on nt
i . audio file generator ( nomad )
ii . video file generator ( intel )
d . i will also be loading office 2000 ( which i have )
the problem :
a . when i travel , terminal server doesn ' t work ( last time i spent several
$ hundred trying )
b . on the weekends , terminal server unacceptably slow ( requiring someone to
come in sat & sun )
c . when we move internally , things go wrong ( this monday we got switched from
100 megabytes to 10 mega bytes ) - trader ' s report not ready on time
d . i currently have no stand - alone backup for contingency purposes
what i need :
i need help putting windows 98 put on my thinkpad
( when i reformatted and loaded , it did not recognize the modem )
there should be no security risk because this system will be totally
independent of enorn system ( just usinf the phone )
can you approve someone to help me load it up ? ? ? thank you .
