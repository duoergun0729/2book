Subject: model effort in houston
christian ,
our spring / fall window of " ? nactivity " is rapidly eluding us . . .
we need to get our internal model operational without delay .
along these lines , let ' s go ahead and plan your visit to houston as soon as possible ,
but by all means get you in at least 4 weeks before hurricane season .
that would mean the month of may looks good .
please inform me what duties you could not perform from here to support the sydney office ,
we ' ll figure out how to keep that office whole .
( it ' s working without a hitch to have steve bennett in london , but continuing his houston duties )
if the first week in may ( for the whole month ) will work , please respond asap and we ' ll get housing arrangements finalized .
looking forward to your visit ,
