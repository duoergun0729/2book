neil ,
you must have already gotten my earlier mail of clarification . going
forward , i agree with you that we should start the assigment early rather
than late .
however , i would not necessarily like to wait till even feb 5 . the bids for
lng must go out by the 15 th of feb , and we need to do a lot of fuel based
analysis before then . hence , if it is possible for anshuman ot be available
before then , i would greatly appreciate it . perhaps even as early as monday
or tuesday if possible ? ?
regards ,
sandeep .

thanks for the clarification vince i appreciate it . we have a significant
resource problem here in india , given we have a renegotiation about fall in
our laps . anshuman is one of our key analysts and we are very proud of his
abilities and future potential for enron . once we have dabhol off the " life
support system " we could look at a longer assignment . as far as the present
one month assignment is concerned , i would rather go for an early start say
5 th feb till 5 th march . is this convenient to you and jeff .

neil ,
i would like to apologize for the confusion regarding anshuman .
we have floated a number of possible scenarios regarding his
trip to houston and there was a lot of confusion
regarding the terms ( given that i was talking to sandeep
every few days ) .
currently , we expect anshuman to come to houston for one month
to work on the dpc project ( at jeff shankman ' s request ) . the lawyers advised
me that we need an ll visa for him , irrespective of the duration
of his stay .
sorry for the confusion .
