molly : just to be sure that everyone understands , anshuman cannot work in
the us on a bl visa - he can only come here for business meetings and
training .
we will have to get him the ll visa in order for him to work in the us .

molly ,
i shall ask sandeep to do it when he comes back from india next week .
i have just learned that anshuman has bl visa and he can start on a project
as a person
delegated by dhabol power company to houston . to be absolutely above the line ,
i would still arrange the ll visa .

i agree that it makes sense to put the ll in place . there are several things
we will need from you in order to start the visa process . the first is a
fairly detailed job description for anshuman . secondly , we also need to know
whether or not he will be in a managerial position here and / or managing a
project . if there is someone else in your group who can furnish this job
description , just let me know and i will be happy to contact him / her .
as for sandeep , i have been told that he is a u . s . resident so there should
be no problems with him . margaret daffin will be contacting him to be
absolutely sure .
thanks ,

molly ,
let ' s get ll for anshuman , just in case . i am sure he will stay here for a
while
once he comes . it is quite obvious jeff shankman will have to keep him
longer ,
given the priority of the project .
i assume there are no problems with sandeep .
thanks .

thank you for the update , vince . i have been working with margaret daffin
with regard to anshuman ' s visa status . we will have to get an ll visa in
place before he can come to the united states , even in a temporary
capacity . do you want to move forward with that effort at this time , or
is the possibility of him coming to the u . s . so remote that it wouldn ' t be
worth the time and money right now ?

molly ,
this is an update on anshuman . please , see below . it seems
that his transfer is not an issue for the time being .
we can put it on a back - burner till he gets here .
vince
p . s . the relevant section .
i also spoke about anshuman , and there was resistance to his leaing for such
a long time . however , i have agreement from folks here to send him to
houston for a shorter stint on dpc budget . i will try to finalize that
before i leave . i will call you in the evening to just chat .

vince ,
just wanted to let you know that i had a meeting with wade cline ( coo , enron
india ) , neil mcgregor ( president , dpc ) , and mohan gurunath ( cfo , dpc ) today .
though i had already spoken to all of them earlier about my joining your
group , today it became official , and all of them supported the move . i
explained to them what we would be doing , and the results expected from the
henwood study .
dpc would like to pay the costs for the study , and that was mentioned . there
maybe some tax issues etc . that need to be cleared , and other related issues
that i would like to discuss with you , so i will leave them till i get to
houston .
i also spoke about anshuman , and there was resistance to his leaing for such
a long time . however , i have agreement from folks here to send him to
houston for a shorter stint on dpc budget . i will try to finalize that
before i leave . i will call you in the evening to just chat .
i am very thankful to you for giving the opportunity you have . things here
have deteriorated dramatically over the last few weeks . morale is quite down
due to many lay - offs .
i am really looking forward to returning to houston , and the family ! !
regards ,
sandeep .
