Subject: re : tradespark
vince ,
thanks for the tradespark article .
i very much appreciate being able to participate in the applied learning
projects . it has been very stimulating for me . i ' ve really enjoyed all the
projects i ' ve worked on with the research group , and ever since my interview
i have had plenty of second thoughts about going back to graduate school .
i ' m sure mit will be a good and unique experience , but i wonder if it can
help me find a job and a community i enjoy as much as i already have here .
if possible , i would like to talk with you and / or stinson about the
possibility of my staying on the research team , or coming back after the
fall .
thanks for your time .
