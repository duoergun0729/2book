model development complete 4 weeks 15 july mack
* integration of model and data feeds into cts 6 weeks 30 august kirkpatrick
prior to integration into cts any prices would have to be manually uploaded

the rfp will include a request for a smaller data calibration set that we may
select to purchase immediately .
we can revisit this schedule at our wednesday video conference .
