Subject: anshuman
neil ,
i would like to apologize for the confusion regarding anshuman .
we have floated a number of possible scenarios regarding his
trip to houston and there was a lot of confusion
regarding the terms ( given that i was talking to sandeep
every few days ) .
currently , we expect anshuman to come to houston for one month
to work on the dpc project ( at jeff shankman ' s request ) . the lawyers advised
me that we need an ll visa for him , irrespective of the duration
of his stay .
sorry for the confusion .
