beth ,
i enjoyed talking with you this afternoon regarding possible enron / argonne
national laboratory collaboration . as i mentioned , one of our divisions ,
decision information sciences has built state of the art tools for modeling
and simulating energy use . they have trained many country energy ministries
on the use of their tools as well as solved complex energy technology issues .
i ' ve attached a presentation which describes some of their capabilities in
this area . decision information sciences also has done much work in studying
critical infrastructure issues in both gas and electric systems which also
may be of interest . finally , they have been pioneers in the development of
agent based complex adaptive systems for modeling very complex systems that
are impossible to view with over approaches .
i will also include a copy of my correspondences with one of your e - business
groups under separate transmission .
