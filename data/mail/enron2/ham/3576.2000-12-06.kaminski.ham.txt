subject : wti trading simulation model - presentation
john ,
i put together a presentation of the simulation model for wti market maker
for you .
the p / l results are investigated by assuming different scenarios .
the key variable is the number of trade per day , therefore is varied from
200 to 1000 trades .
scenarios are generated by different spreads , net open position allowed , and
time period .
take a look what i have prepared , and let me know things you want to add or
delete .
if you have any questions , i will be happy to discuss with you .
zimin
ps : this presentation is only for the open - close trading . i will produce
exact the same
sequence for the continuous trading ( close - close ) once you approve the
content .
