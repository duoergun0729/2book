Subject: color copier information
kevin ,
please see the following websites for features and specifications of the
color copiers currently available to enron and pricing is on an attacment @
the bottom of the mesage . let me know if you would like to meet with any of
the reps or if vince / mike / shirley or yourself would want to take a trip to
the vendor location for demonstrations on any of the equipment listed below .
these color copiers are only supported by the vendor and the lease would be
between your group and the relative vendor . response times have been
specified as 4 hr from the time the call is placed to the vendor tech
arriving during normal business hours . after hours service is available @
premium rates , yet to be quoted = let me know if you require this after hours
service pricing .
epsc key - op does not currently support color copier equipment and as such ,
someone in your group would receive the necessary training for low level
maintenance { jams / toner / staples etc } . you would also need to store the
necessary supplies for the selected color copier .
