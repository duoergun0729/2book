Subject: michael sergeev ' s rotation
hi mike , as per our discussion i have managed to find a place for michael in
ebs ' d . c . office . it is likely that he will work for me on the ebs side but
will live in d . c . i will finalize that later . vince had mentioned that it
is okay with him as long as it is okay with you . so please double check with
vince on this .
i suggest the following transition :
start date in d . c . may 1 , 2000
from now till the start date , michael will slowly transition into my group
but make sure that your activities are transitioned into someone else . but i
would like to propose the may 1 , 2000 date as hard start so that michael will
have to start moving few days before that , etc .
regards ,
ravi .
