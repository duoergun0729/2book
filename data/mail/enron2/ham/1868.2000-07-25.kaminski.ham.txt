Subject: re : final pivot table for mg metals globals positions data
dear all ,
please see attached spreadsheet - we will have to think of a way to automate
the position update - right now it ' s a manual process to convert the text
file that andreas sends us to proper spreadsheet format and then pivot table
the results - only takes about 20 minutes to do this however . note that the
version la var model links via vlookup to the spreadsheet attached ( as you
know , we have to use vlookup because mg does not necessarily have positions
in all forward months , whilst the pivot table only produces numbers for
forward months with a position ) .

our pivot table ; we noticed that copper position for 19 th july has option
included but this is not reported in mercur - i guess we should include the
5 , 248 tonnes for the copper option for 2000 . 09 , but we won ' t show any gamma .

hi tanya ,
we are using the data for 19 th july from andreas - see file attached . we are
using this because we can reconcile to mercur print out that we got from
andreas last wednesday . if you don ' t mind , perhaps cantekin can try again
with this new sheet attached . we already looked at it , but would like to see
what cantekin can come up with independently . i think the positions changed
a lot from 3 rd july ( your data ) to 19 th july .
thanks ,
anjam & kirstee
