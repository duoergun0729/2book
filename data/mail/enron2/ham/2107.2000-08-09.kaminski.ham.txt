grant ,
i agree . we shall give him an offer of a job in houston ( on the terms
we discussed with ) plus an option to stay in
london , if he does not like houston . his choice . i think we extended a very
generous offer to him
and he may have an excessive perception of his contribution to enron .

vince :
i got the following note from uk hr after had a call from them earlier
today . i told them that the deal you and i communicated to anjam was firm
and not negotiable ( with the exception of the issues regarding the flat
rental ) . apparently , anjam is trying to play hard ball . what ' s your
commitment to anjam ? should we explore a package deal ? my vote is no .
grant .

unfortunately , we were unsuccessful in our attempt to convince anjam that he
should transfer on a local us package . the difficulty is not so much the
compensation and benefits , it seems more to do with the actual job and
long - term prospects . he will only , therefore , commit to 12 months and only on
assignment terms .
we explained to anjam the rationales for transferring locally , ie not just
cost but equitability among his peers . he is convinced that his skills and
enron knowledge are valueable enough to warrant an assignment rather than a
local deal . also , he was apparently told by vince that it was impossible for
you to find a local hire for this role as you were not paying the market
rate .
would you like to move further with this ? if so , we can put together costs
for you for a 12 month assignment and see what you think . i am out tomorrow
but back in on friday and could do it for you then .
let us know !
regards

dear vince i would like to make
the suggestion that we make this opportunity a one - year assignment working
with tanya , and then re - evaluate the situation at the end of the year in
terms a new role for me in houston thereafter , subject to mutual agreement .
the alternative situation of resigning from enron europe and re - joining enron
corp is too dramatic and requires me to " burn bridges " and my return to enron
europe would be difficult . also , i would lose the valuable support
structures available to me in london . the amount of any fixed costs
( flights , modest cargo , a few months of mortgage carrying cost ) are entirely
reasonable , not excessive given my single status and not so great that they
justify making the contract a three year ( local ) one .
i would expect that on the basis of almost 3 1 / 2 years solid experience &
value - added at enron europe , the value of several million pounds i have
identified & justified to external auditors for enron europe this year and an
" excellent " rating ( my fourth making my 3 1 / 2 yr average rating also
" excellent " ) , i could reasonably be expected to justify a fair deal ( i . e . my
existing enron europe salary & benefits package plus a reasonable one - off
allowance to cover unavoidable additional personal expenses ) .
regards & thanks again for the opportunity ,
anjam
