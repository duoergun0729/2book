becky ,
the charges to corp . go to rac and are based on my projections of expected
expenses .
the charges are based on the following assumptions ( percentages in the
parenthesis show
amount of time allocated by each person ( group ) ) to rac :
1 . value - at - risk group ( var )
md ( 25 % )
vp ( 60 % )
director ( 100 % )
5 managers ( 100 % )
2 . enterprise wide risk management
manager ( 100 % )
associate ( 100 % )
currently we hired ( or will shortly hire ) 4 managers for the var group . the
expansion of the var
group was planned based on the requests from rac for more support .

becky ,
i am discussing these allocations with the appropriate groups within
corporate , as they will be the ones accepting / rejecting these charges . i am
forwarding this to the appropriate individuals within the corp . departments
for their review . so , do not consider corp as " in agreement " until you hear
back from me . i also reviewed what we are receiving in 2000 and i have a few
questions relating to both 2000 and 2001 :
1 . what is esource ?
2 . what is ena ops direct ?
3 . what is ena occ direct ?
4 . what is ena co 021 ? is this vince kaminsky ' s group ? the charges for 2000
have been about $ 16 k and $ 20 k to the rac group , so at that rate , i would
expect 2001 to be no more than $ 250 k - $ 300 k , but the plan amount you sent is
$ 1 . 9 mm . i will need some detail on this .
thanks ,
steve

attached is the 2001 preliminary inter - company billing . ena will be billing
plan numbers for all departments except for external legal and external tax ,
which will be billed base on actual . a quarterly review will be done to
determine the variance between plan vs . actual amounts . if the variance
amount is material , we will adjust the billing to your business unit
accordingly .
if you have any questions , call me at 5 - 7094 . please review this billing ,
and notify me with any questions by wednesday , december 20 , 2000 ; otherwise ,
it is assumed that you agree to the intercompany billing from ena .
you are the only person in your business unit receiving this invoice . if
this invoice needs to go to someone else in your business unit , please
forward to the correct person and can i be included in the forward e - mail ?
