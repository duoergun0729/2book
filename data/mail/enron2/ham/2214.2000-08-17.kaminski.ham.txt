vince ,
we had spoken a few weeks back , but were unable to meet due to our
schedules . i will be back in houston next week ( august 21 st ) , and would
appreciate the opportunity to meet with you and take your advice .
as i may have mentioned to you , i am interested in exploring opportunities
that are more us focused . i think paula corey has already forwarded my
resume to you . however , i have attached it to this note just in case .
i would really appreciate the opportunity to meet with you next week , and
would be grateful if you could let me know what time fits best with your
schedule . i look forward to hearing from you .
regards ,
rahul
