Subject: 6 / 30 aga forecast at 66
mike ,
my number for next week is 66 ( from seasonal holt - winter model , shw ) .
i am also fitting aga to an arimax model . as discussed , i need weighted
temperature
data for east , west and production areas . i would appreciate if you could
provide that data .
after that , i could add forward price curve as explainatory variables .
since aga is a market mover , it is important to have an accurate model .
