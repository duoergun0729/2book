Subject: potential new analyst
hi guys
a number of us interviewed a guy named matthew williams last week for an
analyst position . he has a phd in particle physics and experience with monte
carlo simulation ( albeit in fortran 77 ) from his academic work . he ' s also a
good communicator , having completed a postgrad course in acting , and has been
active in the theatre as performer and director .
if he accepts our job offer then ( after discussion with dale and bryan ) we ' ve
decided to give him his first rotation in research here in london . i hope he
accepts .
i ' ll keep you posted .
