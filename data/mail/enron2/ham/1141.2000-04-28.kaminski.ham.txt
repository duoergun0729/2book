vince ,
i am traveling at this time , attending a nsf meeting in washington .
however , i wanted to touch base regarding plans for your presentation in my
class on real options next thursday ( may 4 ) . as you recall , the class is
from 3 : 30 to 6 : 30 , and you could plan to take a significant part of that
time for your presentation . sheridan titman has agreed to join us after his
class at about 6 : 00 for a 30 minute " panel discussion " with the students on
issues related to real options in practice . l
i am not sure about your travel plans , but we would be happy to plan
lunch on thursday with several of my colleagues . i would also be delighted
to be your host for dinner on thursday night if that is convenient for you .
i ' ll be back in my office on monday , and will look forward to
hearing from you .
