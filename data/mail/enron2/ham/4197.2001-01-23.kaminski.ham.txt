everyone should read the attached risk article about calculating def probs
from cds quotes .
amazingly it is in pretty close agreement with our own methodology for both
cds valuation and reverse engineering def probs . the only extension in the
reverse engineering is that instead of linearly interpolating cds quotes ,
they propose minimising an error measure based on ' smoothness ' of def prob
curve and difference between model and market prices .
what is also amazing is the fact that this article has been published in
risk , given that it is essentially the same as my credit pricing paper , plus
one excellent idea . given extra time , resources and brainpower , there is no
reason why we shouldn ' t have similar work published ourselves .
