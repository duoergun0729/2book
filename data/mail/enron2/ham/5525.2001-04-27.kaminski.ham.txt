vincent ,
congratulations on spearheading the mind ' s eye madness event - it looks like
quite a success . my biggest disappointment is that i am leaving enron this
week and have been too busy to participate as much as i would like . i have
had continued interest in the work and presentations that amy oberg has
done , so would have really enjoyed the workshop yesterday . i am still
considering doing some or all of the motorcade friday , however that may
work .
separately , thanks for the update in the lobby today on the enterprise risk
project . please keep in touch with me . as i mentioned , my redeployment
period ends tomorrow ( april 26 ) , but i currently do not have an outside job
lined up and still have a lot of interest in the project if something can be
worked out over the next few weeks . although he is not in the same group as
david port , i have worked a lot with brad larson in the rac underwriting
group - he may be a good source of information on me also .
