dear mike
i would like to apply for the above position as advertised in " earthworks " and
enclose my full cv ( in word 97 / 00 format ) in support .
i am currently a research fellow with ucl conducting research , and building
forecasting models for the statistical prediction of north atlantic sea
surface
temperatures and other climatic parameters at long leads ( 1 - 12 months ahead of
forecast period ) .
i have recently applied this model to the north sea in order to aid long - lead
forecasts of fish stocks ( see sap - symposium , 4 - 6 december , bergen , norway ) ,
and
have recently been applying similar models to the north atlantic oscillation ,
an
atmospheric phenomena which is strongly correlated with winter climate over
uk / norway and nw europe , particularly temperatures , rainfall and windspeeds
( see
enclosed poster which was presented recently at an international conference on
the nao in vigo , spain )
as you will see from my cv , i have 2 + years experience consulting in several
areas of geoscience to the oil , gas and minerals industries and have good
programming skills , both on unix machines and on pcs .
i am particularly keen to apply my skills in the commercial sector and
initiate
a permanent career path .
i look forward to the opportunity of hopefully discussing my skills further
with
you in the near future .
yours sincerely
tony hamilton
