steve ,
i shall call you tomorrow about it . my preference is to move anjam to houston
for some time . anjam knows a lot about our business and specific positions
and it ' s better to prevent a potential leak . i have discussed this issue
with dale and richard and they concurred .
i don ' t expect anjam to act irrationally but it ' s better to be safe than
sorry .

subject : contingencies
hi vince
if you ' re currently engaged in drawing up contingency plans for the anjam
situation , have you arranged for a " snapshot " of his computer directories to
be taken ? we all tend to use our personal areas ( on our h : drives ) for
development , and obviously there ' ll be a few years of work in anjam ' s
directories . i wouldn ' t want him to wipe it all out in a fit of bad temper .
although our it dept . obviously makes backups , i don ' t know how long they are
kept for .
cheers ,
steve
