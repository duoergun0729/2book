dear vince ,
how are you ? well i hope .
i hope you don  , t mind me writing to you . you may remember that 5 months ago
i left risk publications and moved to a charity . having been here for only a
few months , i have decided that this job is not for me ( i miss the buzz of a
corporate office ) and i have decided to move back into the corporate sector .
because of my previous experience and knowledge of the energy sector , i am
very interested in moving into this area . i have always thought that it
would be great to work for enron because it is such a dynamic company and i
am planning to approach the london office to discuss any opportunities ,
which might be available . i am particularly interested in product marketing
and research , although i am very open - minded at the moment . i wondered
whether you could recommend the right person to speak to in london .
i know that you are incredibly busy , but any help you can give me would be
fantastic vince .
thanks and best regards ,
vicky windsor
