Subject: cuiaba models
hey ding . if you recall , we looked at southern cone during july , as this
was the feedback that we got from our presentation in late may . the cuiaba
gas and power volumes may be found in several different places since there is
more than one model . the models do not necessarily agree with each other . i
have attached a few models that should contain the necessary info . i also
have a summary sheet template that was to be attached in maps . enjoy .
