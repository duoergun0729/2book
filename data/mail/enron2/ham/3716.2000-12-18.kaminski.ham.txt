vince :
as i am sure you are aware , we are facing significant challenges with the
dabhol project . as i have delved into the project and our problems , i have
been disturbed by our lack of information / data relative to our position in
the grid and the overall fundamentals for the region . i would like to meet
with you and get your assistance in identifying some resources to try and
help the india team develop a better understanding of their market and how to
identify / develop / use the fundamentals .
thanks .
jim
