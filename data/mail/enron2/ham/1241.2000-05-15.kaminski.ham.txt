dear energy in europe speaker
as the conference in berlin draw closer , i would like to remind you that we
urgently need to receive a copy of your presentation materials by friday ,
26 th may 2000 .
if you could please send me a hard copy of your talk text or copies of any
slides you plan to use , as soon as possible i would be most grateful . i am
sure you are aware of the importance of documentation , even if you plan to
speak off the cuff please try and supply at least an outline of your proposed
speech . if this material doesn ' t reach me by 26 th may i am afraid they will
not form part of the delegate packs . you can send a hard copy either by post
or fax to the above address and details or you can e - mail it to me at the
following address : ttulsi @ icbi . co . uk .
if you have already sent copies of your presentation then please ignore this
fax . should you have any queries , please do not hesitate to contact me , and i
look forward to seeing you in berlin shortly .
kind regards
