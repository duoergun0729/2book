debbie ,
we asked dba to refresh stage this monday .
it was refreshed on thursday . jin is running vatrfacs today ( friday ) to
create correlations and factors .
then , according to our plan , we will ask ramesh to run var on these inputs .
we will send the inputs to you to run var in the spreadsheet and reconcile
the results for uk .
