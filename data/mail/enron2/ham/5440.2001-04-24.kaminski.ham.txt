dear giuseppe :
unfortunately , i am no longer with the associate and analyst recruiting
department and will be unable to assist you directly . please contact tracy
warner , who is now responsible for recruiting . she will be able to assist
you directly . tracy can be contacted at tracy . warner @ enron . com . i would
also recommend having vince kaminski contact her as well to ensure that all
communications are in order .

subject : from a previous summer intern
celeste , my name is giuseppe a . paleologo and you amy remember me : i was
a summer intern last summer in the research group , and attended the
hiring event this year at stanford . in that occasion i had an informal
offer from vince kaminski , and the assurance that i would receive a
written one in the following two weeks , but since then i have not
received any letter from enron . i would like to know if the offer is
still valid , and if it has been sent . i am asking because i am in the
process of evaluating my offers , and would like to wait for enron before
i make my final decision .
thanks in advance ,
giuseppe paleologo
