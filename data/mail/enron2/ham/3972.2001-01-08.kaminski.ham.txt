dear vince :
?
after a very great deal of thought , i have decided to stick it out with el
paso .
?
please be assured that this exercise was not a " fishing expedition " to
extract concessions from el paso . ? rather , it is simply that , although i
continue to harbor doubts about some of el paso ' s methods and about the
people running the business , i have concluded that two months is not enough
time to fully judge the company . ? i feel that i have not yet given el paso
( or myself for that matter ) a fair chance . ? after all , if i disagree with
the way the business is run , i should regard that as an opportunity to
effect changes and not an excuse to run away .
?
please extend my sincerest thanks and apologies to all those who worked so
hard over the holidays to produce the offer : david oxley , sheila walton , and
especially norma villarreal .
?
and thanks also to you vince for your patience , humor , and good advice . ? as
i ' ve said before , i consider it an honor to be able to call you a colleague
and friend .
?
with best regards ,
grant .
