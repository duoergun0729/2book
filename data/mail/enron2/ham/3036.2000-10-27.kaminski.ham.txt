Subject: martin jermakyan
hi there ,
i am favourably impressed by martin . i think he ' s an intelligent person
and understands the power industry . he has good ideas about
modeling various of things ( even though he thinks that
technical constraints are just technicalities and are easy to deal with ) .
please take note that he admitted he does not like to
write code ( he has / had someone else doing it for him ) .
