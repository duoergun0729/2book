Subject: the national forum on corporate finance
mr . fastow ,
i ' m writing all of our participants and confirming plans for the upcoming
corporate finance meetings on may 4 - 5 here . as a reminder , you are slated
to sit on the executive option / equity dilution panel on saturday
morning . dave yermack from nyu , the number one expert on this issue , is
presenting at that session . ( again , serving as a panelist should require
little preparation on your behalf . )
also , you and your wife are welcome to attend the dinner on friday evening ,
may 4 . it will be held in the baker institute across from the business
school . tom copeland is our speaker - ( i think he plans to focus his
remarks on real options ) . vince kaminski has told me he will be at the
dinner , however his wife is out of town and will not be .
please call me direct if i can be of any help or assistance . i look
forward to seeing you soon . i ' ve attached a copy of the program along with
a name rooster of those planning to attend .
