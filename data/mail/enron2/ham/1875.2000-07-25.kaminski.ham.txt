Subject: mg metals - london research responsibility
dear all ,
please ensure that all requests for metals research support in london are
directed / forwarded to me in the first instance ( e . g . option pricing , var ) .
this is to ensure speediest response time and to avoid duplication of effort
as well as confusion on the part of our mg counterparts due to multiple
( duplicated ) requests for information .
tanya and i are currently developing version la of the var models for mg
metals . vince , ted and mg metals are looking to tanya and i to provide
leadership in this area for the integration effort and after production of
var v . 1 a , i will look to pass on responsibility for mg metals var systems
integration to kirstee hewitt for the london side .
regards ,
anjam ahmad
