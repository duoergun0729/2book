john ,
i propose accelerating steve ' s move to head the research group here . it
makes sense to include this as part of the mid - year prc process by giving him
a tangible reward along with his performance feedback .
thoughts ?

vince - i agree with your conclusion here . we are still trying to fill
dale ' s structuring role as well so part of the question is
how we announce steve ' s lead research role relative to when we know who will
take dale ' s spot . perhaps we should just
move forward with the steve announcement the day that dale moves full time to
ebs . i will ask richard lewis to take the lead
in working with you on finalizing the decision and communcicating the changes
to the organization .
but i do want to reinforce how pleased we are to have steve here . he is a
wonderfull asset to our efforts .
thanks !

john ,
i am writing to you regarding the management of the london research group .
as you know , dale surbey , who was managing the london unit of the research
group ,
is moving to ebs . dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of
talent we have currently
in london .
given that dale is likely to be transfered to houston , it ' s time
to nominate one member of the research group for a management position .
my recommendation is steve leppard . steve emerged not only as the most
technically qualified member of the group but also as a natural leader ,
highly
respected by his peers and internal customers . steve has a very high energy
level
and is very efficient as a manager and as coach of new talent .
his promotion is likely to cause anjam ' s departure form enron . i value
technical
skills of anjam , but in spite of my loyalty to him , don ' t think he is the
same caliber
as steve . however , i would not like to lose him and think about moving him to
houston
for 2 years . i think that the opportunity to work in houston , would be a
sufficient
incentive to keep him in enron . by the way , his performance feedback has
greatly improved .
please , let me know what you think .
