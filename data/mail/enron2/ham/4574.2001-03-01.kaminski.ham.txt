moyez ,
thanks , i will try and collect the information today . vasant and i were
thinking that it would make sense to let people try the application under the
test environment for a few weeks . then we can incorporate any additional
suggestions and move to production around the first week in april .
our meeting room does have a screen and network connection , and we can
profide an lcd projector as well . how about thursday of next week ?
thanks ,
stinson

stinson ,
sorry to have to do this to you but i need some additional information in
order to add these users to the research projects group . please use the
attached template to capture the information needed and forward to me at your
convenience . also , the group has only been set up in the test environment .
do you want to add the users to the test environment or are you ready to
migrate to production ?
as far as the demo is concerned , i  , ll be happy to accommodate your group .
how many people do you expect at the demo and does the room have a display
screen and network connection ? let me know which thursday you would like me
to conduct the demo and i  , ll be there .

moyez ,
can you add access to the following users for the livelink research projects
database ? also , would you be available to give a short demonstration and
tutorial on how to use livelink for our group ? we hold a lunch meeting
each thursday from 11 : 30 - 1 : 00 in 30 cl at which there is usually a short
presentation on a topic of interest . i think it would be very useful for the
group to have an overview of how to use the tool before everyone jumps into
it . the presentation can be quite informal . let me know if you would be
available in the next couple of weeks .
