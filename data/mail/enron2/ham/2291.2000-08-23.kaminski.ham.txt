i ' ve asked vince to get involved with you about getting li into vince ' s
group . this issue needs to be resolved by week ' s end - - we look like we don ' t
have our act together , and that bothers me . especially since we are about to
make a significant monetary investment at wharton , and we could have a new
wharton recruit disgruntled .
vince , can you set up a meeting with you , me and mark palmer to follow up
with our meeting with skilling ? thanks very much . . .
jeff
