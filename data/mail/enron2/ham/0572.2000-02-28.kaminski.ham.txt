shirley ( 3 - 5290 ) is making travel arrangements for me .
it makes sense for all of us to stay in the same hotel ,
irrespective of individual travel arrangements

dear vince ,
thanks for your note . i look forward to seeing you on the 20 th .
we usually recommend our visitors to stay at the park hyatt on battery
street . it ' s a 5 minute cab ride ( or an easy 15 minute walk ) to our
offices . should you decide to walk , it is important that you take sansome
street rather than montgomery . they are one block apart , but one goes up to
the top of telegraph hill and ends before continuing at the bottom of a
cliff and the other is relatively flat and is continuous . there are
detailed directions on our website ( www . kmv . com ) .
see you on the 20 th .
regards ,
rob
