Subject: re : copier on 32 nd floor
kevin ,
please let me know when your move date has been " firmed up " . can you let me
know the location that you want to install the new copier at { i will need to
check for the necessary power outlet } ? listed below are some of the latest
generation " heavy duty " copiers that enron has been installing as replacement
for older equipment such as the xerox 5388 etc . feel free to try them out for
the specific task that you have on a daily basis and let me know what you
think { we can discuss relevant speeds & associated $ costs after you have
tested these copiers } :
fyi : there are 2 other models from lanier : the 5355 and the 5365 . both of
these are the " toshiba 70 series " digital copier rebranded as " lanier " . if
the one of the toshiba 70 series listed above meets your criteria , the 5300
series from lanier is a better cost option between the two different brands .
if possible , would you be available to meet next week to discuss further ? i
would like to invite a member of the ena finance group to go over cost
allocations for the new copier , regardless of which copier selected .
thanks , iain . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
