joe ,
he is a research assistant of prof . darrell duffie from stanford
and i met him in this capacity . a very bright fellow .
i could not assess his commercial skills but he has enough common
sense to identify the winner ( as his interest in enron demonstrates ) .

dear vince kaminski
thank you so much for the kind invitation for the meeting .
i have been always inspired by and having respect for the
recent revolutionary achievements of enron in the energy markets
my former employer mckinsey tokyo in fact featured
your company * s success in the last quarterly , and it clearly states
( in japanese though ) that the quantitative research capability at enron
is now at the world * s top level , which has been always behind the scene .
i am extremely honored to receive the email from you and in fact
interested in knowing the opportunity of working in the energy field ;
however , very unfortunately i will have to come back to japan , or at
least to the east asian region , upon graduation due to an inevitable
family reason . my wife * s father passed away recently and an old
mother - in - law is now left alone without relatives . i understand that
enron has not yet embarked on the next big project of freeing
the outdated japanese energy market , ( which by the way i strongly
hope ) so i may not have a very good chance of making contribution
at your company right now .
lastly , if you need a staff in tokyo in some future who understands
both the risk management analytics at the f 622 level and the local
language and business custome better than average , please contact
me any time . i will be happy to assist as much as possible .
yours sincerely ,
