patrick ,
we have those two models in the exotica library . you need to add exotica . xll
located in o : \ research \ exotica \ xll to your excel before you can use the
functions .
you can find the documentation in o : \ research \ exotica \ doc .
example spreadsheets can be found in o : \ research \ exotica \ .
the precedure of addin is as follows .
1 ) clik tools / addin on your excel
2 ) choose browse and got to o : \ research \ exotica \ xll
3 ) select exotica . xll or its identical copy exotical . xll
4 ) answer the question " copy . . . " no .
5 ) click ok , then you should see exotica menu bar pop up .
if you have any more questions please let me know .

how do i get access to these options models ? who can i visit with in the
houston group if i have any questions regarding the models . your help would
be greatly appreciated . i am located in singapore , so i would probably be
