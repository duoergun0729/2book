dear celeste and kristin :
i am re - sending information regarding the wharton entrepreneurship
conference and the opportunities to sponsor the conference as well as
participate in the expo . we are expecting the conference to double in
size with more than 1000 attendees . in addition , we would like to
emphasize that the spirit of entrepreneurship is alive and well outside
of the " dot . com " world including in large , innovative companies such as
enron . we have already lined up some smash hit speakers including
christy jones of trilogy and pcorder as well as anita roddick of the
body shop . we would be very interested to have the participation of
enron in the conferences as a sponsor or at the very least , a
participant in our career expo .
thank you very much for your time and consideration .
sincerely ,
cassandra santos
