Subject: eol presentation
thank you for meeting with the students from rice university ' s jesse h . jones graduate school of management in april . the students greatly appreciated the opportunity to talk with you . your perspective and insights into eol and its competitors helped the students gain much more useful information in their interviews with enymex , houstonstreet . com , ice , dynegydirect , and other energy e - commerce platforms .
the students will present the results of their research next monday ( may 7 ) at 4 : 00 p . m . in room 49 cl . we would be delighted if you can attend their presentation . if you cannot attend but would like a copy of their final report , please feel free to let me know and i will make sure you get it .
thanks again for your help .
