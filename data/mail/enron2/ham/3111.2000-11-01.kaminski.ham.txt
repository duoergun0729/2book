subject : meet during cmu visit ?
dr . kaminski :
i am a ph . d . student here at carnegie mellon who has a long - standing
interest in the energy industry .
i have recently developed the framework of a simple model for electricity
prices that i would like your opinion on . could you please chalk out some
time for me during your cmu visit this friday ?
unlike traditional electricty pricing models , which assume that the
log - price is a sum of a couple of stochastic factors , i assume that some
fundamentals of the electricity market are driven by stochastic factors .
next , given the current values of these factors , price is determined by
economic forces of profit maximization by price setting electricity
generators . unlike typical factor models , the factors in my model are
potentially observable .
thank you ,
