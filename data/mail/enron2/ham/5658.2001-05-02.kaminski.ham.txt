Subject: re : installation of new programs
i gave you local admin rights on your laptop yesterday . what you have to do is to log into the laptop using the local
machine account . the id and the password is the same as your corp login now . the password on the local account will
never change . if you have a minute today i will show you how . let me know a time .

subject : installation of new programs
phillip ,
how can i install new programs on my laptop , without
the administrator ' s privileges ?
one example : when i travel i use aol to get access to my mail
and to communicate with the office . windows 2000 does not allow
me to install it .
also , i have my private statistical software
i often use when i work at night during business trips .
i would like to load it as well .
