what a kind and thoughtful man you always are , vince . . . . i have always
appreciated
that in you ! i just moved to another position this week - with sheila
knudsen in ena
compensation , but i will always remember how wonderful you are with the
associates
and analysts in the program , and will miss having the opportunity to touch
base with
you occasionally . thank you for being the special man you are !
carol
p . s . i doubt that you know who i am , but i had worked with the program for
two years ,
having been hired by mike smalling in october 1998 . when i first moved to
houston
( from ohio ) and enron , i rode the # 35 bus for a short while . you helped me
find enron the first
day i rode it , but i didn ' t know who you were until i saw you at our super
saturday
activities . you will never know how much that assistance meant to me - a
shy ,
street - dumb girl from toledo , ohio , in a city like houston , who didn ' t know
how to
ride a bus ! all of enron loves you , and i know why !

you are right , vince . . . . celeste and i did discuss it , and she approved his
feb . start date .
datren does know about that , so it sounds like it is cleared up .
thanks so much , and we are sorry for the confusion !
