vince ,
i don ' t know if you are already aware of this , but maureen raymond has been taken ill and i understand has received medical advice that she should not travel before the end of next week at the earliest .
tara is the appropriate hr representative in london ; i will ask her to keep both you and houston hr informed of the situation .
many thanks , tani
