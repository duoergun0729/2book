maureen ,
the energy ceo roundtable hosted by gov . johanns has been scheduled for
april 20 th 10 a . m . - 2 p . m . does this date work for you ? as we have
discussed , your presentation would provide the governor and his guests with a
national / global perspective on pricing trends for natural gas , electricity
and oil and their impact on agricultural production costs . we may also
include a hedging presentation , but have not committed to do so yet .
your presentation would be scheduled at the start of the meeting , w / an
anticipated length of twenty minutes . a university of ne ag economist will
provide a state perspective for the group . following the conclusion of both
presentations time would be allotted for questions . we expect approximately
20 people to attend the roundtable .
