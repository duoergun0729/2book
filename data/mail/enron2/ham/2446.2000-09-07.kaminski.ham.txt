michael - we have a contract with weatherwise to launch the weatherproof bill
here in our service territory . the wpb is a hedge for customers and , to some
extent , a weather hedge for us . we are not buying a typical enron - like hedge
from them , however .
if you want me to talk to ronnie i ' d be glad to .

an associate of mine from research , ronnie chahal , is working for the enron
subsidiary newpower and was wondering if pge uses weatherwise , a derivatives
provider for weather hedges among other things . ronnie is trying to get some
background on them . if any of you know whether pge uses this service , please
contact ronnie or me and let me know to whom ronnie could speak about pge ' s
experiences with weatherwise .
thanks ,
michael
