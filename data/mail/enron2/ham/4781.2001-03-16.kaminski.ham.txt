Subject: maureen ' s expenses
it appears that administratively maureen ' s expenses in coming to london
cannot be processed from this office . can i confirm that there is no doubt
that the london office will pay these . could i therefore please ask shirley
to process them in houston , and we will find out how they can then be charged
back from research in houston to the london metals cost centre .
thanks in advance for you help .
