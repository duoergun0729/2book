Subject: clean fuels - gpg business segment
dwight and i are working to develop an updated valuation for the mtbe and
methanol business segments . we would appreciate assistance from your group
in assessing the market over the next 3 - 4 years .
with the octane shortage this summer , and the strong gas and oil price
environment , mtbe prices are well above budgeted levels . how will
political / environmental issues affect mtbe prices over the next few years .
methanol prices are also now very favorable , but it would seem that north
american methanol producers will be disadvantaged if gas prices in na remain
higher than the rest of the world .
your thoughts on these and any other factors affecting prices would be most
helpful . both dwight and i are available to meet with you or a member of
your group as soon as convenient .
thanks , sorry we missed you today .
