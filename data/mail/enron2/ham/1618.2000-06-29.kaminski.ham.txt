Subject: re : chapter 3 revisions
dear vince and grant ,
please find attached our butchering of your work ( only joking . . . ) . we ' ve
tied the chapter in with what has gone before and changed some of your
notation so that it is consistent with ours .
vince ; could you please send thru the footnotes referred to in the chapter
at your convenience . could you also please supply a full reference for
routledge , seppi , spatt ( 1999 ) .
grant ; i hope you don ' t mind we ' ve called pdjd just jd ( to fit in more with
our work ) . please also can you supply the last figure before you disappear !
do you want us to write the summary ?
many thanks again for all your efforts . it ' s all looking good .
best regards .
chris .
