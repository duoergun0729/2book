Subject: re : latest revision
vince ,
i got the zipped version fine . thanks the only outstanding items relate
to the complete references for your papers ( the book publisher and dates ) .
i spoke with shirley this morning and she is tracing this down for me .
i re - read the gas market paper segment on the take - or - pay contracts and
corrected my " oversight " . by the end of the day i hope to have all the
corrections that you gave me incorporated in the manuscript . we will make
them on the galley pages of the article when it arrives .
thanks again for all your help .
john
p . s . i also spoke with mary joyce ( she returned my earlier call a week ago
when i was trying to ask cindy something ) . all is well . at 10 : 15 am
