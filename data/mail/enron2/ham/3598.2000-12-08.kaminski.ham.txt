thanks for the referral on this matter . we want to be the best and honor our
affirmative action and accessibility responsibility to all people , so we plan
to satisfy at least the priority 1 points in the web content accessibility
guidelines put out by the world wide web consortium . in addition , we will
continue to monitor and improve as we develop new tools . thanks again
have a good weekend !
