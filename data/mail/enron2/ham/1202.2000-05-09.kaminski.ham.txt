Subject: re : development of a program in " econo - physics "
hello shirley ,
i ' d understood from yannis that he ' d proposed a brown bag lunch where i ' d
give a talk and then the discussion about various possibilities would
follow . i ' m here until about mid - may and then will go on leave in europe
for a year . i could be available to make trips back and forth from time to
time to get things started .
best regards ,
joe mccauley
