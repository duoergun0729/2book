hello vince ,
how are you this week ?
my week is pretty relaxing - i am taking the training for the very last
product of my company , called voicenet , and i will achieve the highest state
of initiation with destia ( viatel ) products , ha . . .
unfortunatelly i have not been promoted for business vip representative ( the
position associated with t - 1 ) as i do not have any experience with it .
i am blaming myself because i cannot discipline myself to study consequently
every day for gmat .
all the best to you and see you on saturday .
patrycja
