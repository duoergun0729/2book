ehud ,
sorry i shall miss you on thursday .
i shall definitely attend you presentation at power 2000 .
i shall ask about a guest accounton eol . typically , such an account allows
an outside user to take a look at the system , but i don ' t think the traders
will allow
systematic access to the price data over a long period of time by a third
party .

vince ,
greetings .
i am following up at this time with respect to the above issues we
discussed in san antonio .
1 . i am leaving thur . morn for philadelphia , and shall not be back until
late fri . ( my etd is 9 : 40 a . m . , which i understand is less than an hour
before your arrival . . . ) thus i shall regrettably miss your current ut
visit , which we had hoped to also use as an opportunity to present / discuss
my enterprise - wide risk management model .
2 . that said , i shall be presenting an abridged version of this model at
power 2000 ' s first day , 5 / 9 4 : 15 - 4 : 55 p . m . while i realize you ' ll be
very busy over power 2000 ' s two days , should your schedule permit , i should
most welcome the opportunity for you to see the model .
3 . per your suggestion in san antonio , i would like to take this
opportunity to inquire whether i might obtain an enron on - line account to
obtain electricity prices quoted by enron .
i look forward to seeing you at power 2000 . best regards ,
ehud
