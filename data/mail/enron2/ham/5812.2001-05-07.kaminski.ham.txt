vince ,
i have left a voice mail to you and will wait to talk to you personally .
my brother vikas , who is now in london , is trying to make a switch from
consulting world to working for a specific firm . over last few months , i
have heard of great deal about the success of enron on line business which
fits well in the area of his expertise . i am wondering if you know of some
one in london who he can speak to regarding career opportunities .
since i spoke to you last , a number of things have changed . recently , my
manadate was broaden to include leading a charge for developing a risk
management function for both the domestic and international businesses for
gmac . needless to say , this is exciting albeit making the life a little
more hectic than usual .
talk to you later .
