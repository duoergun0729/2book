hi jaideep !
my first suggestion is that you come to houston as scheduled ( and arranged
with wharton nearly 3 weeks ago ) . alternatively , rely on your tiger
teammates to gather information necessary to respond to the project . should
circumstances lead you to decide not to come for this trip , please return the
ticket issued to you . should it make sense for you to visit enron some time
in the future , we can discuss arrangements at that time .
hope to see you soon !

subject : houston trip
hello christie ,
thank you for organizing the wharton trip to enron . unfortunately , the
flight setup for tomorrow is way too early for me as i ' ll have to miss over
4 hours of classes , which i cannot afford to do . i tried changing the time
with continental and there latest flight leaves at 6 pm - which does not work
for me ( smack in the middle of my 3 hour class )
thus the dilemma that i find myself in is the following :
a . try a different flight as i can make any flight after 7 : 30 pm ( however , i
have no control over reservations / budget etc )
b . as it is possible to delay travel upto 1 year , use this ticket to come
some other time
sorry for this but i just saw the bookings today .
any suggestions ?
thanks ,
jaideep
