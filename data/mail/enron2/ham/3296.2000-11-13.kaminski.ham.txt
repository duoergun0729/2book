eric ,
i have a number of case studies on enron but not the one on sutton bridge .
i know that peter tufano was working on it but when i checked the hbs
site and tried to purchase it , i could not locate it .
when i talked to peter a few months ago , he told me that the case study was
ready
and he was going through enron ' s internal approvals .
i cc mark palmer on it . maybe he knows about this specific case study .
i wander if it was completed , given sutton bridge developments .

where might i find copies of the case studies enron has published ? i ' m
particularly interested in the sutton bridge publication for havard but would
like to know if there is a library of case studies .
