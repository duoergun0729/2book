vince and ravi ,
attached below is the resume of a student graduating from the university of
chicago with an ms in mathematics . his specialty is financial mathematics
and his coursework seems to have covered a lot of the sorts of things that i
understand your group to do , vince . he is extremely interested in enron and
contacted me because i am an alum of the college at the u of c . i gather he
didn ' t go through enron ' s typical recruiting process for analysts or
associates because his background is more technical , than commercial . he
acknowledged that his business experience is limited and from his resume you
can tell that he is young . he would therefore be willing to start as an
analyst or whatever the equivalent would be for a non - rotating position , but
his interest is in doing the kind of work that you do , vince , and ravi , i
know you have a similar background .
please let me know if this candidate would be of interest to either of you .
if so , feel free to contact him directly . he would like to start work this
summer after graduating in june .
thanks for your time and i hope this is useful to you .
regards ,
laura
