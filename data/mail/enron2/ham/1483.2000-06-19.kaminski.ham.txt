Subject: initial collection of research material for your web sites
dear sven the packets cover electricity and gas markets and modelling ,
deregulation & exchanges , weather derivatives and value - at - risk / risk
management / case studies . this is by no means final , and i hope to supplement
with some more ideas over the next few days . once you have considered the
material , i can fine - tune the type of material that is relevant for you and
then we can look at starting to put something together , after which we can
pass on to mike roberts
if you need some simple articles on pricing options or an explanation on how
to calculate volatility , then i am sure we can put that together for you .
regards ,
anjam
