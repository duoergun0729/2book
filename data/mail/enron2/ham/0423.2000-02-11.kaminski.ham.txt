Subject: thanks for your help ! !
vince ,
my apologies for writing to you after such a long gap . i wanted to thank you
for the book you sent , as well as al the help that is been rendered by
krishna towards our efforts here
our efforts here are becoming more intense and i will continue to need your
group help as we proceed along the way .
separately i have not yet forgotten about the training we had spoken about .
however , give the intensity of our current effort we may need to hold on to
that for some months . in the meantime we will continue to work together .
once again i would like to thank you and krishna for all your help and
support .
thanks and best regards
sandeep
