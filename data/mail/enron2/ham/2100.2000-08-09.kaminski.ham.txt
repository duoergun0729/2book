Subject: talk to us
over the last several years , we ' ve received numerous questions and candid
comments from many of you on a wide range of topics during our espeak
sessions and through the office of the chairman online mailbox and
voicemail . while espeak is an open , informal chat between employees and
management , the office of the chairman online mailbox and voicemail box are
designed as confidential upward feedback tools for employees who choose
anonymity . we are pleased that many of you have openly expressed your
thoughts and your identity , which made it possible for us to quickly respond
to your questions and concerns . this is the kind of work environment we all
must strive for at enron , and we encourage you to continue sending us
comments about the things that are important to you .
many times , however , we wanted to respond to those of you who contacted us
anonymously with your good ideas , observations and questions . we now have a
way to do this while maintaining your confidentiality . in the future , when
we receive an anonymous question or comment from an employee , both the
question and our response will be posted on emeet . this will allow us to
answer all the questions that we receive , and it will give other employees an
opportunity to provide their insight , if they choose to do so , since emeet is
an open discussion board .
remember : you can send your questions and comments to us in two ways :
- email to office of the chairman , or
- office of the chairman voicemail box at 713 - 853 - 7294 , which is a
confidential call
promoting open and honest communication is consistent with our vision and
values and absolutely vital to our continued success as a company . so don ' t
be hesitant or afraid to speak your mind . we want to hear from you .
