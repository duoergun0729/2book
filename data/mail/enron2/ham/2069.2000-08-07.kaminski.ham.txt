subject : enron - nevrl - aa meeting on july 27
dear amy :
thank you and your colleagues for taking the time to video - conference with
us at mit and aa professionals associated with nevrl . i enjoyed the
exchange and was left impressed by the technical savvy and keen interest in
research on part of enron . i look forward to hearing from you sometime
soon .
as i recall , we agreed that enron would forward a few issues / questions that
nevrl could potentially address . once we have a meeting of minds on the
set of issues , we can discuss further how best to collaborate and
accomplish our goals . i believe both sides would benefit immensely . mit
faculty can research questions relevant to industry and you might receive
some answers you are looking for !
with best regards ,
s . p .
