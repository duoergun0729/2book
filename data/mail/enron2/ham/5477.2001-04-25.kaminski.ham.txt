Subject: harvard - - nyu itinerary
hi !
attached please find the itinerary for the harvard - - - nyu trip ; please
disregard any parts of the trip that don ' t apply to you .
if i have not already done so , i ' ll try this morning to get you a copy of the
enron online case being taught at harvard tomorrow ( thursday ) . otherwise ,
i ' ll give it to you on the plane - - it ' s fewer than 15 pages , so it ' s a quick
read .
please call me if you have any questions ( 3 - 6117 ) . otherwise , i ' ll see you
at the corporate hangar at 6 pm .
( for anyone unfamiliar with the location of the corporate hangar , i believe
you can get a map / address / directions from the enron aviation department . )
thanks !
