Subject: bad supervisor : me !
norma ,
i have attached an updated org chart for my team .
i think the following changes need to be made
1 . paulo issler is reporting to zimin lu
2 . shalesh ganjoo is reporting to me ( who does the system show as his
supervisor , zimin ? )
also , i just found out that chonawee did not get his mid - year review . i
didn ' t realize that samer takriti never gave him a review . i have found all
of the mid - year feedback for chonawee , but i don ' t have an official " form " to
fill out for him to sign . can you send one to me , or what should i do ?
thanks ,
