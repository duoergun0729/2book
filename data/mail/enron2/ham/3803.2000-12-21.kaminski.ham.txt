Subject: rac organization changes
the continued growth of the enron europe office and related businesses has
prompted a change in the management of risk assessment and control ( rac ) in
london . effective in early january , 2001 , ted murphy will transfer to the
london office and manage the rac activities which includes credit / market risk
and underwriting . ted will continue to manage the enron global market risk
activities . steve young , currently managing rac in london , will begin a new
assignment within ebs , also in london .
the houston market risk group will be managed by david port .
as enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses , it
is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent
and accurate manner across the company . hopefully this realignment will
accomplish that goal .
please join me in congratulating ted , david and steve on their new
assignments .
