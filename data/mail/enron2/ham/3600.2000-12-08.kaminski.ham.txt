i am with the ebs venture capital group . we are looking at evaluating an
investment in a company called widevine out of seattle . part of their value
proposition involves certain patents on genetic programming . are you familiar
with that ? if so , can i set a meeting with you and a few other members of my
group to discuss on tuesday or wednesday ?
