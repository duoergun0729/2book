mr . kaminski ,
?
nick perry and i were recently discussing the conference in paris , and we
gathered that you had some interest in exploring possible uses of our new
weatherdelta tool - kit . ? it is the only application that we know of , that
can ? model temperature , loads , and power prices in several locations
simultaneously : thus allowing the user to measure the value an risk in a
variety of financial instruments , physical obligations and assets . ? i have
attached the product overview sheet , and would be happy to discuss its
capabilities with you at your convenience . ? ?
?
nick and i send our regards ,
?
