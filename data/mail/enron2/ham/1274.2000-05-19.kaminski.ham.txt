Subject: re : cplex floating license
samer ' s suggestion makes a lot of sense . we can start with something like one
floating dev . license + 2 opl licenses and buy more later based on actual
usage . on the pricing agreement , it probably makes sense to get a guarantee
on the discounts for additional licenses for one year ( or till dec . ) . i am
definitely interested and can provide the share of funding necessary from my
clients .
thanks ,

subject : re : cplex floating license
chonawee and i just had a phone conversation with cplex . there are other
alternatives ( products ) that may help in saving time and cost . chonawee and i
feel that one floating develoment license , and one or two opl ( a package on
sale that provides modeling and optimization features ) licenses will do . in
addition , we need floating deployment licenses . for the development licenses ,
the charges should be split " equally " between the different groups that may
ask for optimization help ( although it is hard to predict who may ask for
future help ) . we are suggesting equally since these licenses are used to
develop the needed solution but are not ( in general ) used to run the
software . the deployment licenses can be charged on per - use basis for
different groups .
cplex is going to send us a new quote . we ' ll make the decision soon after
that .
