Subject: interesting article about enron in japan ' s electricity newspaper
japan ' s electricity newspaper ( " denki shimbun " , the equivalent of megawatt
daily ) has been running a series of articles about the new century . several
of these have focused on the power industry in the u . s . a friend of mine ran
across one on enron that was published on april 13 and sent it to me . i
thought you would find it interesting .
the article focuses on ees in particular and about how we try to succeed by
being first to meet our clients ' changing needs . it also describes how we
use derivatives and risk management to reduce costs and stay competitive .
the article also briefly mentions the new office in japan .
the most interesting thing about the article is how incredibly positive it is
about enron . given what i have read and heard about how nervous the japanese
are about deregulation of the industry , i really did not expect such praise .
denki shimbun also has a web site at " www . shimbun . denki . or . jp " . they have
small summaries of the important articles of the day ( the site , however , is
completely in japanese ) . another interesting site is
" www . criepi . denken . or . jp " , the english home site of japan ' s central research
institute of electric power industry ( denryoku chuo kenkyuujou ) . the site
has many links to other english - language sites related to the power industry
in japan .
