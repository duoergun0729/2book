Subject: saturday
on saturday i came to work and did some things that i needed to do .
also , there were some things left undone that i felt i should do .
mainly the conference room - we will schedule all birthday ' s and meetings in
the large conference room therefore , i made the room look more spacious .
also on monday - we need to check with the painters too see if they are going
to repair our walls .
we also need to get the additional pictures from the cage and get
them placed on the wall whereby the move can be completed .
if either of you have any questions or know of more things to do please
let ' s get together and discuss .
thanks
