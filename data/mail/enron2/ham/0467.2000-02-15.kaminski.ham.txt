( md & vp of enron research group , respectively ) . martin will work for jim
irvine and report to him on a day - to - day basis . martin will spend most of
his time at jim ' s office location . this arrangement is very similar to samar

start on march 1 , 00 . ebs research will be working very closely with jim
irvine and john griebling in the area of network planning and model
development ( traffic engineering in telecom - speak ) . martin has a ph . d . in
