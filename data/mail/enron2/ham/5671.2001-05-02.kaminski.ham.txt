vince :
ken rice received a call through a friend ' s referral from dr . tom limperis ( a
professor at the university of michigan ) . dr . limperis has developed a
statistical database management system he would like to show enron . ken
would like you to return this call on his behalf . he feels that you are
probably the only person who will understand and be able to determine if
enron should have an interest .
do you mind returning this call ? please let me know .
thanks !
