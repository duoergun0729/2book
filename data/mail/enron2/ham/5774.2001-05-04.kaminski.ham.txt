Subject: organization announcement
given the growth in ees it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate
the risk functions between ees and ews . this will provide ees with the
systems , resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market
opportunities .
with this in mind and in agreement with the management of ees , two new risk
groups inside enron americas will be formed to provide ees with pricing ,
structuring , retail and wholesale commodity risk management , logistics and
back - office services . these groups main function is to provide these
services to ees . we have asked rogers herndon , currently vice
president - trading in the eastern power group to manage this function in the
eastern interconnect ( this includes both gas and power ) . rogers will
continue to report to kevin presto . we have asked don black , formerly vice
president - ees risk management and sourcing , to manage this function in the
western u . s . don will manage this group from houston and will report to tim
belden .
these groups will work very closely with ees to pursue shared goals while
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading
organizations .
these changes are effective immediately . please congratulate rogers and don
on their new roles .
