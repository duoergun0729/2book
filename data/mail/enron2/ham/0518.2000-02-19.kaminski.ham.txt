hi , vince please put your best effort in making sure that we differentiate
summer interns and associates that ebs research will be hiring . i am talking
about compensation here . ken rice mentioned that ebs is in the process of
developing a technical equivalent of our aa pool . ebs research people can
potentially rotate through this pool in the future . i just don ' t want to
risk losing people like giuseppe ( & get the word out that we are low - ballers )
because we have to fit them into certain set of categories that was designed
for the energy business . i realize that you have estabilished such
differentiation for research as a whole , but i think that would have to be
moved up a notch in the case of ebs .
