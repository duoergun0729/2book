Subject: re : firm power sale from phase i - issues
vince / vasant ,
it has been some time since we spoke at the san antonio conference .
unfortunately , as soon as i got to india i was diagnosed wih a slip disc and
had to be in bed for a long time .
in the mean time the team continued to work on the concept of a sale to
another state out of the dabhol plant . i have developed the concept whereby
we are now looking at a firm component ( over peak period ) , and an infirm
power sale during the monsoon .
the series of quesions and comments from my team in te attachment below
should help you a bit to get a feel for the proposal . i am currently in
houston and reachable at 281 - 345 - 9870 . i maybe needing a surgery for the
slip disc but am currently on medication hoping that surgery won ' t be needed .
i would like to wis you all a very happy x ' mas and a great new year , and will
catch you in the new year in houston to discuss this wit you further . i can
see that soem structuring help will be needed on this , and would like to get
some help from your end .
regards ,
sandeep .

subject : firm power sale from phase i - issues
as discussed , please find enclosed a word document which essentially
discusses most of the issues involved with a firm power sale of 50 mw from
phase i , which would have to be sorted out with mseb .
vivek
will put the tariff formula in the next mail )
the tariff structure & the issue list obviously need further refinement ,
before we discuss it with mseb .
looking forward to your comments on both the issue list as well as the tariff
computation .
