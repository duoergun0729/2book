thanks for the update , vince . i have been trying to discuss this with you
for several days , but i know that you have been very busy . jaesoo told me
that he wanted a base of $ 90 k rather than the $ 85 k which you had authorized
me to offer him , and i told him that i would have to discuss it with you and
get back to him . i am glad that he has seen his way a little more clearly ,
and i will call him tomorrow to finalize the offer .
