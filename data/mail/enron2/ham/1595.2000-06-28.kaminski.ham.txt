vince :
thanks for your help in this matter . i dont want to be a bother to you . i
know you are doing your best to put this together as a go between .
as you might suspect , i am in a hurry to put together the right hearing at
enron because marketpoint is just now being completed - - u . s . and world oil
and gas and north american electricity . we have just signed up our first
web provider ( e - acumen . com ) , who is preparing to vend our north american
electric generation data base over their website . i believe we are an
integral part of their offering . it wont be long before marketpoint needs
the capitalization to meet our growing customer needs professionally and
quickly , particularly when we sign up one or more vertical portals to vend
or offer fundamental forward projections from our models . i a loath to do
so without the capitalization and staffing we need . also , i am loath to do
so without the market reach that a partner like enron could render instantly
available .
i also would be eager during my next trip to houston to continue the
discussion with you regarding how marketpoint might benefit enron directly .
i plan to be there the last week in june .
thanks again for all your help and support .
