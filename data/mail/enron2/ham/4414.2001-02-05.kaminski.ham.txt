donna , i had also passed along the resumes of two reliant energy tiger team
members , david gershenson and james iker , who were both interested in
working for enron this summer . i had spoken to vince about these candidates
when we were in houston , and he said he would arrange internships for them
as well .
he should already have copies of their resumes and cover letters . please let
me know if you have any questions or need clarification .
thanks ! !
