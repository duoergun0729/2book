hi lupe !
there are approximately 25 boxes , several small file cabinets and 2 plants ( a
3 ft and a 9 ft plant ) that are ready to be moved from 29 to 19 . this is part
of the 29 th floor 12 / 17 churn .
the items are located in various offices of the " fishbowl " area on the 29 th
floor . they are labeled with the 19 th floor designated location .
there are 2 larger file cabinets that are located in the hallway .
the 2 plants need to be taken to ebl 944 .
is there anyway to work this in your schedule on tommorrow ?
thanks
linda
