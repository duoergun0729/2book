vincent ,
i have forwarded the resume to our analysts / associate pool with
a recommendation to accept david as a summer intern .
i expressed interest in taking him into my group . he may , of course ,
work for a different unit of enron . it ' s up to him and i shall not be
offended
if he would like to go into trading or deal origination .
vince
