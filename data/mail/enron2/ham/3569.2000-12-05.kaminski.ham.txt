vince ,
following your espeak session , erin rice suggested i contact you about
joining your group . i have been with ees for almost three years , and during
that time i have worked on tasks that are similar to what your group does on
a larger scale . specifically , i excel at analytical / quantitative problem
solving and the development of models and user requirements for application
development . my educational background is energy management , and i have
recently become involved in the financial aspects of transactions . i have
attached my resume for your review , and i hope you will call me so we can
talk in person .
thank you .
