subject : here ' s a third try ! ! !
vince ,
while i was at hsb , i designed an insurance or reinsurance financial model
that hsb uses for new product development , pricing different reinsurance
strategies , computing stochastic earnings forecast , and estimating
probabilistic maintenance & repair costs . the code , written in visual basic &
ms access belongs to hsb , and i want to replicate it here for our use at
enron . i would like to arrange a time to specifically talk to you and perhaps
vasant who was briefed on the model , about how we can use your group for the
analytical and programming support to get this model re - constructed .
i have screen outputs from the code and vasant thought the re - design and
construction here at enron is a problem that your group can do . could you let
me know when we can setup an hour to discuss ?
thanks ,
rick jones
