Subject: risk 2000 panel discussion
dear all ,
?
would like to set a conference call to discuss content for the panel
discussion at risk 2000 in boston on 14 june . perhaps i can suggest
wednesday 31 may at noon est . i ' m on london time and am quite flexible if
you would like to do earlier or indeed on another day .
?
the panellists are -
?
vince kaminski , enron corp
richard jefferis , koch energy trading
steven bramlet , aquila
?
the discussion topic is ' effectively applying weather derivatives '
?
i think we need to establish a series of questions around which to
facilitate discussion . we currently don ' t have a moderator and perhaps one
of you could take this role on .
?
i look forward to hearing from you .
?
