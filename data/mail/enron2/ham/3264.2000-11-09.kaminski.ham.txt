Subject: webi proposal
vince : per your request , i am forwarding the electronic version of the webi
proposal . as i mentioned to you yesterday , jeff shankman has procured funding
for enron to join at the corporate partner level , so you may wish to discuss
the matter with him prior to circulating this document . this funding is in
addition to that which you and christie have already committed to other
research and sponsorship activities at the school .
please let me know if i can be of any further help . i look forward to seeing
you again soon .
by the way , i cast my vote on time and with no confusion ; let ' s hope the
outcome is as we hoped it would be .
