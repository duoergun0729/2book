christian -
i was thinking that your expertise in grads and grib formats will help
enron to obtain
a competitive edge over our competitors . development of the grads
visualization tool
will allow our international offices to obtain the mrf ( medium range forecast
model ) data first ,
without being dependant of internet sources . additionally , i think that we
could obtain
mrf ensemble data via the same sources as well .
can we include in the agenda the development of these tools ?
