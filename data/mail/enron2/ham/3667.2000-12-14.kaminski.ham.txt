daron ,
we are not yet finished with jeff ' s presentation , and probably won ' t be
completely finished until tomorrow afternoon - just about the time that
jeff will leave for dallas . in addition , e - mailing the complete
presentation may not be an option due to the size of the file .
i ' ve asked hamd to e - mail you want we have right now so that you can test
it with your system . we ' ll then send a cd with the entire presentation
along with jeff to dallas . i ' ll ask jeff to deliver it to you at the
dinner wednesday evening , so perhaps your av people can test it that night .
daron , i apologize for any inconvenience this may cause . if you have
another idea as to how to handle this situation , we ' re certainly willing to
entertain it .
thanks , srs
