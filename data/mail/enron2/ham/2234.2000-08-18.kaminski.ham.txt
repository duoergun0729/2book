Subject: hello guys
vince and stinson ,
just got a copy of the attached paper and thought it may have some interest
for you guys .
on another note , i am putting together a workshop in the spring on the new
economy and business education and will be seeking out some enron network
people to join in the discussion ( 2 - hours on friday march 2 nd ) . i ' ll let
you know more as we work through the details . the idea is to " brainstorm "
about the new world you guys work in every day and its implications for
what we should be doing . hope this is interesting to you and that you ' ll
want to spend the day with us .
take care and enjoy the weekend .
