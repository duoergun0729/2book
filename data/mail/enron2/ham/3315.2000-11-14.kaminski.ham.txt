good morning , vince !
as i will be on vacation ( tomorrow until monday the 27 th ) , i ' m enlisting
elena chilkina ' s help in producing this monday ' s ( 20 nov . ) newsletter .
here ' s how i hope it will work :
i ' ve asked alex huang to try to get his article to you by friday for your
review .
i ' m attempting to get with sharad today to get his photo and remind him about
the bio piece for page one . he should be the feature for monday .
i will also schedule a person and an article ( probably from charlie weldon )
for the 27 th . if alex ' s article is a two - parter , we ' ll just do part 2 that
day instead .
for all submissions for this coming monday ' s issue , i would ask that they be
e - mailed to elena chilkina
if you notice something i may have missed , would you please let me know ?
thank you !
sam
