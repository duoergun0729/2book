got a little scared at your first sentence i read " he is no replacement for
jay but he could be for dennis b . . " ? ? .
anyway :
i think he would be a good fit withing the group . krisna has offered to hire
him in the research group , he has good programing background and is excited
about working for enron instead of a utility such as pacificcorp . he
expressed interest in applying his skill to make $ $ $ $ .
i suggest bringing him in in research as a first alternative . i see three
potential applications where we can use his skills to evaluate best longer
term fit :
continuing ronnie ' s model building role , but with a focus within neil ' s group
to tie rm systems together
bridge the lack of phd econometrics expertise we have as are result of the
departure of anoush .
risk management systems infrastructure development .

he is no replacement for jay but he could be a dennis b employee .
pros :
engineer so would be good at math
his boss hired him a 2 nd time ( 1 at txu and again at pacificor again ) so he
must be reliable
phd in economics and engineering ( good ) from stanford ( ugh : ) : ) : ) )
cons :
does not understand tariffs . i asked him and he said he is not experienced .
i probed too and he does not understand regulatory that well .
does not understand ancillary services ( which is surprising to me since he
started out as an plant operation side of hk power )
has limited people management skills ( he described 1 analyst he works with
that is not capable that he has to jump into the excel spreadsheet and fix it
for him and he cannot give him feedback because it is a utility mentality )
he is not a good communicator ( i asked him to describe what he did in hk
power and it took him forever to explain because he expected me to know that
plant operations meant planning the start up of oil plants ) .
overall :
i suspect that he is a very solid guy when it comes to analysis but not
particularly creative or good at communication and leadership . he would be a
great support person .
i would hire for analysis but not as a potential leader . go
