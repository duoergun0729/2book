Subject: your lap top
vince :
the it migration team called and said that they need an email from you
stating that you do not want your lap top " ghost upped " ? ( not sure if this
is the correct term ) . they said they were supposed to do this to all
computers during the migration process , but since you requested that
they not do this , then they need an email from you with this request .
you need to send the email to : kacee downey / enron @ enronxgate
thanks !
