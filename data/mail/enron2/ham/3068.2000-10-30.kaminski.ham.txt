Subject: lunch conversation
vince ,
we wanted to thank you for your time and support today . we have been
thinking about our conversation and it may be better to wait until december
before you approached delainey . this time period would give us the
opportunity to change his impression of our contributions to gas and power .
please let us know if you would advise differently .
thank you ,
kristin and john
