Subject: managing energy price risk - - second edition
dear vince : i just wanted to thank you for supplying a copy of the book .
the article on the natural gas market is just what i ' ve been looking for .
the new addition , coupled with the first version ' s discussion of the
volatility of the gas market in the mid 90 ' s should be very helpful in
convincing these government watchdog types that basis adjustments in
pricing formulas are not some sinister plot to deprive the feds of their
royalties . or should if there is any rationality in government .
thanks again for your help .
best regards ,
steve williams
