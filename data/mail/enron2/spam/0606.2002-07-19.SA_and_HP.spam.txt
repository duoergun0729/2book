- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - let ' s say that you
decide to start small , just to see howit goes , and we ' ll assume you and
those involved send outonly 5 , 000 emails each . let ' s also assume that
the mailingreceives only a 0 . 2 % response ( the response could be
muchbetter but lets just say it is only 0 . 2 % . also , many
peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands of e - mails instead ofonly
5 , 000 each ) . continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000
e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those
10 people resonded by sending out 5 , 000 e - mails eachfor a total of
50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with
orders . that ' s 100 people responded andordered report # 2 . those
100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mailseach for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails .
the 0 . 2 % response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 . thoe 1000
people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 5 million e - mails sent
out . the 0 . 2 % response to that isl 0 , 000 orders for report # 4 .
those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50
million ) e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders
forreport # 5 . that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = 500 , 000 ( a
half a million ) . your total income in this
example is : 1 . . . . . . $ 50 +
2 . . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . . $ 5 , 000
+ 4 . . . . . . $ 50 , 000 +
5 . . . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . grand total =
$ 555 , 550 . 00 numbers do not lie . get a
pencil & paper and figure out the worst possible
responses and no matter how you calculate it , you
will still make a lot of
money ! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people
ordering out of 5 , 000 people you mailed . dare to think for a moment what
would happen if everyone , or 1 / 2 , or even 1 / 5 of those people mailed 100 , 000
e - mailseach or more ? there are over 250 million people on the
internet worldwide and counting . believe me , many peoplewill do
just that , and more ! method # 2 : placing
free ads on the internet
on the net is very , very inexpensive and thereare hundreds of free places to
advertise . placing a lot offree ads on the internet will easily get a
larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add
method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do
is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always
provide same dayservice on all orders . this will guarantee that the
e - mailsthey send out , with your name and address on it , will beprompt
because they can not advertise until they receive
thereport . order each report by it number
& name only . note : always send $ 5 cash ( us currency ) for each
report . checks are not accepted . make sure the cash is wrapped inat
lease 2 sheets of paper before you put it in the envelope . on one of those
sheets of paper , write the number and the nameof the report you are
