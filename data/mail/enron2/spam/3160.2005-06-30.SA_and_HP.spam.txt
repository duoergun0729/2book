testimonial from dave f . , in nebraska ; first of all , i want to tell you
that i am going to be my own first customer . i won a judgment against a man ,
but he closed his shop , took my property and disappeared . thanks to the
information you gave me , i found him three days after receiving your
training manual . i will use the knowledge gained from you to collect what he
owes me . thank you again . as far as i ' m concerned , your training course has
more than paid for itself already .

perhaps the sound of his mother ' s voice gave him courage , for he boldly
ascended the stairs and entered the workshop , closing and locking the door
behind him
