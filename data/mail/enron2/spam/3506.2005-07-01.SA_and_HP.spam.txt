( fifteen million pounds sterling ) from our bank here ,
i have the courage to look for a reliable and honest
person who will be capable for this important
transaction ,
believing that you will never let me down either now
or in future .
i want to transfer this money into a safe foreign
account abroad
but i don ' t know any foreigner , i am only contacting
you as a
foreigner because this money can not be approved to
any local
bank here in scotland , but can only be approved to any
foreign
account because the money is pounds sterlings and the
former
owner of the account is john hughes and he was a
foreigner too .
i am contacting you because of the need to involve a
foreigner
with a foreign account as the real beneficiary .
at the conclusion of this business , you will be given
35 % of the
total amount , 60 % will be for me , while 5 % will be for
expenses
