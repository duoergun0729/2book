Subject: request 58321
to whom it may concern :
e - request 58321 was sent on 9 / 5 with high priority status . i have not heard back regarding this request , and its approval is becoming increasingly important . bill williams iii , manager of the west real time group , needs to be able to move important e - mail documents from his overloaded inbox into public folders in order to simply send new messages or store incoming mail .
could you please let me know if there is more information i can provide regarding this request and give me an estimated time of its approval ?
thank you ,
