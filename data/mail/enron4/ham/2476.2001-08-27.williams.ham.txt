here is a link to the portland indoor soccer website for mor info .
mike brochaus is the manager of the team , so if you want to play show your
interest by showing up at the first game . i believe the cost to play is $ 50 .
also if you want to play you need to bring a white and maroon color shirt to
every game in case we need to change colors . hope to see you there .
