bill and kate :
attached please find the prior month adjustment items we got from settlements for whourly book . the total p & l impact is
- $ 82 , 555 . 76 . please note that this is still preliminary and please review and verify them ( * i will do the same ) . i am sending them to you just to give you a heads up .
in some of the items settlements didn ' t put the deal number under explanation . i have sent out an email to them so we can know what those adjustments are for . at this time of the month settlements are usually overwhelmed by questions and requests so they might not get back to us before risk needs to finalize the dpr on next tuesday morning for 8 / 31 . if you feel uncomfortable taking any one of the items in your 8 / 31 ' s p symes , kate
