Subject: fw : can you check a deal for me
bill -
mpc looked again and does not show this deal . most of the houston coordinators have responded and they have no discrepancies ( purchase or sale ) on march 14 th . there are 2 who i ' m awaiting responses from still .
i ' ll let you know if i find either side . right now , i ' m inclined to think the inc sheet is wrong and there was no deal at that hour . can you or kate check with the trader who ' booked ' the deal at he 3 and let him search his notes and explain why the mw volumes and prices changed that he in the inc sheet when there is no further documentation . . . . .
thanks ,
virginia
