Subject: fw : possible new e - tag time table
jerry dempsey has sent the attached regarding the preschedule flag in e - tag .
what he is proposing is :
* a revision to the timeline tables in a 3 a to enable software to make
the determination of whether or not a tag is for preschedule or real - time
( currently it is a flag set by the pse creating the tag ) .
* referencing time in terms of the load control area ' s prevailing time
( this fits the authority service is associated with the load control area
and it ' s the authority service that keeps the time ) .
it may be possible to get this revision worked in to the 1 . 7 release .
process
please review his proposal and comment .
specifically , do you support the concept of removing the flag and using the
timing table logic ?
do you support adjusting times to reference the load control area prevailing
time ?
if we reach a consensus on this issue by the end of the week , we can forward
on a recommendation to mark for distribution to the whole isas . if there is
support from all of isas , then it can be taken to nerc is / tiswg for
approval .
please let me know by the end of business june 15 , 2001 .
