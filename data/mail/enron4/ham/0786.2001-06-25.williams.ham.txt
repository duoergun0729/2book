chip ,
as we figured out a couple of weeks ago , most of our ads cards have expired . we were then using brett hunsucker ' s card . if you remember , we were waiting on the caiso to send us new cards and new passwords about two weeks ago . unfortunately brett ' s card appears to have expired this morning as we can no longer log in . we are consequently unable to communicate with the caiso over the ads . we may now be in violation of our participating generator agreement with the caiso . is there something that i can do to speed this process , perhaps lodge a complaint with the caiso or our client rep ? do you have any eta from the caiso on our cards and passwords ? all your help is appreciated .
thanks ,
bill
