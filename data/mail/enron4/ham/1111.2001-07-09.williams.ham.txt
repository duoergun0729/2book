Subject: another time ?
hey , i am back in olympia now . my friends wedding was sunday and i drove
home last night . too bad i didn ' t have the better e - mail address . the
wedding was really good , i tend to get cynical about such things but found
myself enjoying it and even tearing up at times . i saw a lot of people i
haven ' t seen since high school which was mostly good . it doesn ' t seem like
that much changes , a bit of growing up but people are still the same .
jennifer was one of the other bridesmaids , do you remember her ? i used to
call her niffer . anyways , seeing her was especially good .
are you still enginering ? ? ? ( smiles ) when you get a chance , let me know how
you are .
