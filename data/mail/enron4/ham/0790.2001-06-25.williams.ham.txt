Subject: cut
bill , on saturday night i handled a cut on a schedule that we bought from calpine @ mead and sold to valley . we were informed of the cut after the hour was over and the subsequent hours were resupplied by calpine . natalie at calpine agreed to be charged ld ' s for the 1 / 2 hour that the power did not flow and we agreed to an integrated number of 13 mw that did flow however , i told her we would get back to them monday for the exact charges . i did this due to the fact that we sold this power to one of our service customers and i felt we may want to discuss with them first before charging the ld ' s on this transaction . please advise on how to proceed on cuts like this . our sale to vea was at $ 153 and our buy from calpine @ $ 107 . i have entered cut notes with specifics in lotus notes . i will be in on tuesday however , it might be best to resolve this issue monday . thank you for your attention to this matter .
