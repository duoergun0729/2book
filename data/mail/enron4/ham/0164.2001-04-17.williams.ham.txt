enpower it has done an outstanding job in creating this application . it is invaluable to me in verifying that all my deals are in enpower correctly
and the delivery point is balanced . it should be very helpful to be sure that a desk , delivery point and / or region is balanced . please take a look
and come by my desk for a demo if you would like .
