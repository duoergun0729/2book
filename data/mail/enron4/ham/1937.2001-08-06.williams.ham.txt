hi jake and the rest of you ,
i went there too ( 33 rd and powell ) and found that no one was there .
beautiful open field , nets and no one to kick it around with . it does look
like a good place to practice though and it was open on sunday at 1 . i also
know that many of you had told me you were not available so i was expecting
a small turnout but i thought brad ' s team would be there . not sure what
happened i guess brad ' s team either took the week off , moved , or changed
times . if any one sees him ask what is going on . i did try and call brad but
the number i have for him is no longer in service . i also went over to
madison high on 58 th and division where we used to scrimmaged and no one was
their either . i will try an sort this out this week and send out another
e - mail regarding practice . i know justin kerr and adam van loon have
invited us to come out on thursday night 6 to 8 at oregon episcopal school
( oes ) to scrimmage with his high school soccer team for the next couple of
weeks . is that still ok justin or adam ? let us know . sorry about the no
show practice i ' ll try and sort it out . take care .
jon

green roomers ,
declan has informed me of the following info . . .
" brad said that biddys have a practice game every sunday at lpm at the high
school
just off 30 th and powell ( cleveland high i think ) . they would like us to
practice with them each week . "
let ' s plan on fielding a team each sunday at 1 : 00 to play the old biddy ' s
team . should be a good way to stay in shape and organized as a team . hope
to see you there on sunday and if any other news comes up i will drop you a
line .
jon

green roomies ,
we are registered for fall outdoor soccer in the lst division . in first
division we ' ll have our work cut out for us but i think we ' ll do fine and
have fun . the first game is sept . 9 th at 12 : 00 with 9 more games each week
thereafter . i do not know the locations yet but will get that out as soon
as i do . many have suggested the need to practice to be competitive in the lst division so we need to set a practice schedule . how do tuesday and
thursday nights look for you guys ? we also need a field we can count
on . . . . ideas anyone ? in the meantime we all need to be keeping our fitness
in mind . . . running twice a week 4 - 6 miles would be a good start . if we can
hit the fall season in good shape and well organized i am sure we ' ll be a
very competitive lst division team . i have been paid by mike z . , kevin ,
adam , scott , jon b . , mike b . , jay , justin , declan , tristan , and jacob . the
rest of you still need to mail $ 50 to jon gail 8573 sw dakota drive ,
tualatin or 97062 if you want to play . again please send me your
suggestions regarding practice fields and let me know if you have any
questions . later ,
jon gail , manager
