Subject: el paso
as we have moved into the shoulder months of september and october we need to be aware that the el paso load curve is shifting . this means you will slowly start seeing a greater morning ramp than in the past few months . we need to keep this in mind and utilize the dispatch and load curves supplied to us by el paso to ensure a smooth morning ramp . for the past two days the night shift has oversold for he 6 to the point of having to turn on the steamers both days . there is no reason that we shold be selling he 6 and turning on the steamers at the same time . be very careful not to oversell for he 6 . if you have any questions about load curves feel free to talk with bill or a senior member of the group . cheers - - - guz
