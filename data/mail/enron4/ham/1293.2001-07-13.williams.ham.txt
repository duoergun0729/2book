there are two actions required for delano energy on monday , 7 / 17 . first , please try to buy - back he 7 - 10 . they will be running at 25 mw hel - 6 , and then they are scheduled to ramp up to 45 mw beginning he 7 . if you can purchase 20 mw for he 7 - 10 below $ 40 ( their cost to run ) , please do so .
second , we need to sell 5 mw for he 23 - 24 . they are prescheduled for 25 mw , but they will be actually running at 30 mw , so we need to sell 5 mw . their variable costs are $ 40 , so please try to sell above this level .
thanks ,
