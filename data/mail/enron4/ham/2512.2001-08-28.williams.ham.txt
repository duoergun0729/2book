sound reasonable ? or should i be more firm ?
a reminder . . . .
in an effort to curb el paso settlements issues , i ' ve requested several sets of tapes over the past few days . as you know , these are the most reliable resource we have in determining the truth behind our everyday dealings . however , none of the taped conversations i ' ve listened to recently have made mention of the time they were being traded for ; many didn ' t name a delivery point ; and some left out a price .
because mistakes are almost inevitable in a job as abstruse as yours , re - confirming deals just after making them is a valuable habit to form . a quick summary at the end of the conversation can potentially clear up discrepancies at the moment they ' re created , or serve as a tool for resolving them if they make it further than that .
as always , let me know if you have questions about this .
