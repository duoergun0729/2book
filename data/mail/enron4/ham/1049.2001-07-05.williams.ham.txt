a pregunta is a question in spanish . i am going to seattle with my friends from fl on the 14 th - 15 th . the palace of fine arts is just this really cool place in san fran that has huge statues ( greek in nature ) around this gorgeous pond with awesome flowers and trees , etc . it ' s so wierd just to be sitting in the city the way it is . i saw this place that looked similar but in seattle in some movie recently , but they never said the name of the place . i just figured you might know , but thanks for the ideas .

there is the soundgarden on lake washington . . . that ' s more just wacky modern art . there is the seattle art museum ( as its name implies ) . there is the experience music project that is a music museum ( www . emp . com ) and the arboretum has statues as well . i have never been to the palace of fine arts in sf but i can ' t think of anywhere really like a statue garden in seattle . when are you going ? and what is pregunta ?
