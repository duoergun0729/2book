Subject: bill ,
just wanted to confirm our meeting in pdx tomorrow @ 1 p . m . the following is just a brief checklist of hafslund ' s current / potential needs / wants on mw ' s ranging in size from 10 to 150 mw :
* realtime dispatchability of our firm power contracts .
* day ahead parking / lending services at major hubs ( pv , mid c , cali )
* ancillary services bidding from our cogen / qf contracts .
* optionality of services . . . i . e . some days hafslund may not need enron ' s services .
looking for enron ' s price on the bundled services or individual service . would it be a fixed price per mw ? percentage of power sales per mw ? sliding scale based on mw volume and # of services provided ? etc . . . .
let me know if you have questions or concerns or if thursday ' s meeting no longer works for you .
regards ,
