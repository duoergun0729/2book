Subject: delano unit outage 7 / 12 - 7 / 13
group ,
delano suffered a unit outage at approximately 1200 pdt on thursday , 7 / 12 . pandol unit 1 went down due to a boiler tube leak . they expect the unit to return around 1200 pdt on friday , 7 / 13 . they were prescheduled at 45 mw on - peak thursday , 30 mw off - peak thursday , and 30 mw all day on friday . because of the unit outage they are only able to produce a total of 25 mw . bert has already purchased 20 mw through he 22 to cover their peak schedule . please purchase 5 mw for he 23 on thursday through hel 2 on friday to cover their friday schedule . before you do this call the control room to see if they are still expecting to be down through hel 2 on friday . they sold day - ahead at $ 56 . please try to purchase for less than $ 56 , while still taking $ 5 for yourselves ( for example , if you can purchase for $ 45 , then sell it to delano at $ 50 ) .
also , we told the iso that they would only be down through he 24 on thursday , so they wouldn ' t cut our day - ahead schedule . you need to call the iso real - time generation desk ( 916 - 351 - 2488 ) this evening around 10 pm to tell them that you had to purchase replacement power for delano through hel 2 on friday . once again you might want to call the control room just before you call the iso to confirm that they will be returning around hel 2 on friday .
if you have any questions please feel free to call me .
thanks ,
