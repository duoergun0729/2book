i ' ve entered a sale annuity ( 723265 ) between the short term west hourly and short term west services books to divide the july epe scheduling fees . also , it appears the original annuity billed to el paso has been changed to physical , so that should be set to liquidate . please let me know if you have any questions .
thanks ,
kate

the annuity will be entered by the person hired to handle epe ' s scheduling . i will do it for august unless that person is already up to speed . this will be invoicable only for july 1 on . i have added the july annuity already . it was deal # 709630

kathy had a meeting with rodger and the accounting people at epe , and they want to just show everything on the sheet and not do any billing changes in the individual deals . i explained your point and validated that i thought it would help them later with the puc stuff . she told me that she is talking to our settlements person in houston ( amy clemons ) and wants to show it as just part of the overall invoice number each month instead of breaking it out . she said that would accomplish the same thing .
pete is out of the office until monday , but they are going to get his final blessing on this before the final ok is given on procedure .
let me know if there is anything further i need to do on this .
