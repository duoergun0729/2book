Subject: conagra
hi guys ,
i was hoping one of you could help me solve a deal . . . . .
the following is my understanding of what happened :
on 5 - 2 - 01 ( wednesday ) , conagra called epmi ' s scheduling group about a cut to a day - ahead schedule for he 7 .
cara took the call and told conagra that the cut had to be done real - time because it was the day of flow .
cara transferred the call to real time .
i was wondering if any of you took a call regarding a cut for he 7 to one of our schedules going to conagra ? ( it must have been somewhere at the very beginning of your shift ) . conagra says they talked to a male real time .
i find no cut information in the discussion database or in writing and no cuts in enpower . unfortunately , i cannot check the lotus notes schedule information in the database because this day is one of the days that is missing .
conagra is charging us $ 6 , 625 . 00 ld ' s for having to resupply themselves . i ' ve asked them to pull their tapes and tell me who they talked to epmi real time . just thought i ' d get the story from our side in the mean time .
thanks in advance for any help you can provide .
