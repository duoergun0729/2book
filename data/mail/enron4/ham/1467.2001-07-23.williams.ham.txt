we have entered into another lending agreement with el paso for tuesday , 7 / 24 . i ' ve entered deals to show this in our system as a purchase from el paso at $ 4 ( fee for lending - to be changed if we end up actually purchasing from el paso ) and a sale to stsw . this is a 25 mw on peak schedule ( tag entered by lisa gang ) to be delivered at palo verde . we need to send 25 mws ( zero price ) to epe real - time at pv to fulfil our part of the agreement . following are the terms of these deals :
697528 - stwbom buys epe
hlh @ pv
25 mw @ $ 4
( this price represents el paso ' s fee for lending )
697536 - stwbom sells stsw
hlh @ pv
25 mw @ $ 68
let me know if you have any questions .
thanks ,
