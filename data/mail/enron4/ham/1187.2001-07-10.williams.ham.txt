Subject: wheelabrator deal 6 / 17 / 01 - 06 / 18 / 01
chris and heather ,
i wanted to let you all know that i have added some replacement deals to the st ca and st w hourly books that we spoke about yesterday . below is an explanation of why , and i have listed the old deals and the replacement deals . . . . . .
st w services sold a position to the st ca book and st st w hrly desks , but the energy didn ' t flow due to a scheduled outage . since the energy didn ' t flow , the desks entered some sales to wheelabrator to sell back the energy that didn ' t flow . this sale should have been to the st w services book to sell back the position , not to wheelabrator . i zero ' d out the sales to wheelabrator and entered intra - desk annuities . please see below :
