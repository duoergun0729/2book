this is the 37 mw generator in montana that enron has some ownership interest in . they are due to come up off maintenance around june 22 and will have the power available for us to market through the end of june ( before their next qf year starts ) . i have agreed with terry donovan that we would charge $ 5 . 00 / mwh as a services fee and recover all wheeling costs . we can sell this power to third parties or to internal enron books . there will be wheeling in on mt system unless we can talk with dianna about serving mt load with it . it is unit contingent .
