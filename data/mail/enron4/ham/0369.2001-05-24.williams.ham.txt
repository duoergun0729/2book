Subject: anyone else read this ?
has anyone , or everyone , read the latest business practice proposal
that was released by nerc on tuesday ? it is esc ' s scheduling and approval
practices submitted by the multiple task groups - scheduling process ,
approval , schedule timing , granularity and ramping task groups .
specifically , they are recommending changing the ramp time to a
10 - minute straddle ramp ( : 55 to : 05 ) . in addition , they ' re recommending
allowing schedule changes on the quarter ( as already exists at : 15 , : 30 ,
: 45 ) with a 10 minute ramp . their reasoning is , and this is a quote , " large
generators that require longer ramp times ( e . g . 20 or 30 minutes ) , could
partially ramp for 10 minutes across the schedule start , then finish with
another 10 - minute ramp across the next quarter to complete the full ramp .
this would accommodate areas such as florida and wscc , where longer ramp
times are needed . "
their asking for feedback for the public posting . this proposal has
a serious impact on our recommendations . anyone have any comments ? i ' m
attaching a copy of the document . it ' s 21 pages long , about 15 of them on
frag tags . the ramping stuff and recommendations are the last couple of
pages .
