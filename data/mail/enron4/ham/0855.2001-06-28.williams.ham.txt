Subject: re : power trading audit request
tatiana -
after researching these three deals , we ' ve found that our group does not have access to reliable third - party documentation to support their occurrence . because there are no real time confirmation letters , and no nerc tags were done for hourly deals at the beginning of this year , it falls to cash invoices to support the validity of real time deals . i ' ve spoken with stacey white , in houston ' s risk group , and she explained to me that there are documents our settlements group can access that may provide the information you need .
i ' m sorry to keep sending you from group to group , but i ' ll be more than happy to help you get ahold of people who can provide you with relevant deal documentation .
please let me know if you have any questions .
thanks ,

kate ,
i was referred to you by cara semperger in regards to obtaining support for
the following west hourly deals :
deal # 507713 . 1
deal # 528572 . 1
deal # 566541 . 1
to complete our testing process we need to see 3 rd party support ( such as
nerc tag support or 3 rd party invoice ) for the deals mentioned above . since
we are in the final stage of our audit , your prompt attention to this
matter would be greatly appreciated .
please call me directly at ( 713 ) 646 - 6335 if you have any questions .
thank you !
tatiana
