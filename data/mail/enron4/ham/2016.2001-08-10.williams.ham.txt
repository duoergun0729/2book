Subject: ads issue : separation of oom and oos
ads users :
i have received numerous comments from tswg regarding concerns about the
planned implementation of the same service type for oos and oom type
dispatches in ads phase ii . market operations ' current position is that
the market participants have all the information they need to decode oos and
oom , such as what has been bid , what has been dispatched , what proxy bids
have been created based on available capacity , etc . however , we will
consider a change to separate the oos and oom dispatches . in order to fully
weigh the ramifications of this decision , i want to solicit
examples / scenarios where market participant systems would not be able to
correctly settle against a combined oos / oom dispatch through ads .
if you are interested in this issue , please strengthen your case by sending
me an email with comments by 8 / 16 / 01 . i would especially like to see
comments regarding how must - offer fits in , including issues with proxy bids
and whether oom will apply to must offer units .
thanks ,
