Subject: psco schedule on 6 / 17 / 01 he 7 - 8
we had an issue with a psco schedule at fc 345 for he 7 - 8 . craig sold psco 50 mw at the 345 bus . it was not specified which bus it was to be delivered to . there was a tag put out and it was made by us and has psco listed as the pse on the transmission from the 345 bus to the 230 bus . it was denied so that does not mean much . i had a lengthy discussion with psco on this around 7 : 40 am on the 17 th ( turret # 149 ) . you will want to listen to the whole conversation since we take several different directions throughout the conversation . bert also had a prior discussion with them about 3 minutes earlier on turret # 143 . craig should have done the deal between 5 am and 5 : 30 am . i finally got psco to take responsibility for the schedule in a second discussion at 8 : 15 am . they are supposed to put in a transmission request after the fact for he 7 . they claimed on the last phone call that craig did not say " until further " and they will not accept responsibility for he 8 . he is supposed to pull tapes and get back to me but of course i have no faith in psco and am writing this now since , i ' m sure you will hear on the tapes , the guy knows that he is wrong and wants to cover it up and hope settlements doesn ' t get after him .
thanks
