Subject: important el paso phone change - please read
beware -
effective today , we will be taking over both - not just the standard one - phone lines for el paso during off peak hours and on weekends . this means we ' ll get calls that would previously have been directed to roger and steve ' s cell phones . all calls will still ring in on the el paso line . please read the e - mail in lotus notes titled " epe marketing availability " for details .
and let me know if you have questions .
thanks ,
kate
