after speaking with risk and recognizing many inconsistencies in the way that the following deals were done , i have made the following changes that will affect your books :
there will be no deals on the st w hourly books .
st nw will show only pge purchase deal # 529161 . 1 ( offset by swap between st nw and lt nw ) .
all other deals ( 421598 . 1 , 530654 . 1 , 530653 . 1 , 530690 . 1 , 530716 . 1 , and 530689 . 1 ) have been changed to the lt nw book .
i hope this will make things easier .
