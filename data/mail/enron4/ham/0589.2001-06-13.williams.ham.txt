subject : hourly deals to be confirmed
hi kate ,
melissa murphy just notified me that there will be a list of about 10 counterparties ( we do not have the list yet ) to whom we will need to start sending confirmation letters for hourly deals . that is no problem at all , except that i just pulled up the first two ( chris foster specifically wanted us to confirm these two today ) and they have the wrong energy type . they should be caiso energy . these are deals # 640353 , and # 640338 .
i know that the hourly traders are not in the habit of making sure that these energy types are correct , but if we are going to confirm these , they need to make an effort to do so . will you please forward this to them and make sure that all of them are aware how important this will be for documentation purposes ?
thanks so much !
