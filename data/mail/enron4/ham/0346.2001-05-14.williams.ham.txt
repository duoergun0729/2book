Subject: inter - desk deals - 5 / 14 - 5 / 15
i ' ve killed the cal - imbalance deal i entered under short term west bom for 5 / 14 - 609174 - as well as the inter - desk swap between stca and west bom - 609240 .
i double - checked real time position manager and the forward obligations report for this day , and all looks fine . i ' ll keep my fingers crossed that it remains that way until tomorrow morning .
