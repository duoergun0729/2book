subject : el paso
here is a confirm that is designed to go under our eei agreement with el paso . if signed , it would entirely replace our old services consulting agreement with el paso .
please read the document from a business perspective . do not worry too much about the legal boilerplate , of which there is plenty . at the end of the day , the document should contain what you guys think you are doing with el paso from a common sense perspective . pushing all the ( very important ) legal boilerplate aside : do you see our deal in these words ? ? please let me know your comments . thanks very much - - - - cgy
