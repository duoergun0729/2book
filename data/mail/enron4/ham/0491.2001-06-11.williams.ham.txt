Subject: missing bloomberg deals
stephanie -
i believe i ' ve found these trades . the first one already had bloomberg in as the broker along with the appropriate flat fee . the second deal did not have a broker or fee in it - those have been added . please let me know if you still don ' t see the trades .
639921 ( geir solberg ) - sell aep / 25 mw / sp - 15 / $ 105 - deal flows hours 14 through 18 , and broker fee reflects $ 15 flat times 4 trades - $ 60
640346 ( david porter ) - sell transalta / 50 mw / sp - 15 / $ 105 - deal flows for he 16 , and broker fee reflects $ 15
thanks ,
kate
