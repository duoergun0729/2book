Subject: revised ees position 5 / 12
after consulting with our california scheduling team to determine why 5 / 12 volumes on our spreadsheet were not matching up with yours , i have revised my sheet , and i think you ' ll find this new one more fitting . . . .
also , the 5 / 1 sheet has been revised slightly - namely , the np - 15 transmission column . daniel , per our conversation this morning , the np - 15 and sp - 15 on peak prices happened to be the same on this day , so they are correct as you see them in the sheet .
please call me with questions .
thanks ,
kate
