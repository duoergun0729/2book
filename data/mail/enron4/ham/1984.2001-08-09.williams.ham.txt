grace ,
hello , were very excited that you have decided to except our invitation ! !
due to the large traffic of companies that week because of the business
career fair , we will be having two speakers at the meeting on september 26
( your company and enterprise ) . since enterprise accepted first we will have
them present first .
we were thinking that we would a lot you both up to 45 minutes . it doesn ' t
have to be that long though . feel free to present whatever you would like .
some examples of what you could talk about . . . your companies history ,
positions recruiting for , what your looking for in a candidate , what a makes
a resume stand out , a questions and answer section , etc .
feel free to bring treats , or little company toys like the ones handed out
at job fairs . i think enterprise was thinking about bringing pizza .
feel free to contact me with any other questions . i will get in touch with
you when the date gets closer to finalize everything .
sincerely ,
colleen gibson
send a cool gift with your e - card
