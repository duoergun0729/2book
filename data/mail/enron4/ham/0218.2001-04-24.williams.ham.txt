Subject: montana power company march 2001
dear real - timers ,
we are having the same problem with montana power ' s checkout as we had last month : the volume of disputes is overwhelming ! !
i have looked at the inc sheets and found that enpower matches the inc . sheets .
but in fairness to mpc ' s disputes , last month when i trusted the inc sheets , and i pulled the tapes , i found that our inc . sheets were wrong in a number of places .
mike and i are doing the march 2001 checkout and are having trouble finding your logs , your notebooks , or any information regarding the dates in question .
i am listing below the dates and he that we are having disputes for . please look at your logs and let me know the mw value , price , and who you spoke to at mpc at what time . please do not give me what the inc sheets say , as mike and i have already looked at them .
i expect an answer from each of you asap .
