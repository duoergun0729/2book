my response to the questions would be that they get the proxy price during
the mitigated intervals when they do not have a bid in . if they have a bid
in , they get the higher of the proxy or the bid and they submit the cost
justification to ferc . right ?
who do they send cost justification to ?

we are inc ' d pursuant to the ferc order ? is the proxy the inc ? if we do
not have a bid in , do we get the inc ? if we have a supplemental bid in ,
do we get the higher of the inc or the bid ? if we do get the higher
of , to whom do we send our cost data ?
