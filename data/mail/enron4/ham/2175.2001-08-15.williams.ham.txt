Subject: new services customer - desert power
group ,
just wanted to let you know we have a new generator coming on line , desert power . they have 2 units totaling 65 mw , located in utah , and they are in pacificorp ' s service territory . please remember they are in mountain time , so please be careful when speaking with them ( try to always speak in " hour ending _ mountain time ) .
they are running this afternoon , wednesday , 8 / 15 , for the first time . for the first week or so they will be " working the kinks out " in the real - time market . the easiest thing to do would be to either sell them directly to pacificorp , or to buy a wheel from pace to four corners 345 ( or another point of delivery via pacificorp ' s oasis web - site ) . the contract language is set up to where we get 1 $ / mwh for dispatching the unit , plus an incentive to sell them above a certain percentage of the dow jones pv day - ahead index . so , during the testing phase , please just take 1 $ / mwh when you ' re selling the unit output .
if you have any questions , mike etringer was the guy who put this deal together , les is also familiar with the deal , as am i ( to a smaller extent ) .
thanks for your help ,
