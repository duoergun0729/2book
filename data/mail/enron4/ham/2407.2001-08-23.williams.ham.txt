Subject: oasis access needed - enron real time trading
to whom it may concern :
it ' s come to my attention that the srp oasis user id which was being used by enron ' s west hourly trading team has been disabled . holden salisbury , one of our cash traders , spoke with someone in your office about setting up a new id for the real time group . enron power marketing , inc . already has company - wide access to the site ; but the real time group regularly reserves transmission on this oasis site and needs a login name and password of its own .
could you please let me know what information i need to provide to get this set up ? i would greatly appreciate your help in issuing a new real time password as soon as possible , or in directing me to a more appropriate contact .
thank you ,
kate symes
