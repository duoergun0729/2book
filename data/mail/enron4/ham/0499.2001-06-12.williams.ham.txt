Subject: re : a 3 al ad hoc review team
great suggestion . yes , a meeting is needed , especially for same day
timelines .
may i suggest the conference center meeting rooms at the portland airport ?
a fly - in , fly - out meeting 9 : 30 a . m . to 3 : 30 p . m .
if you have a better location or better idea , speak - up . otherwise , i ' ll
check on availability of a room . looks like we are down to the last two
weeks of this month - 18 , 19 , 21 , 22 , 25 , 26 , or 27 .
i ' ll try to send out a list of topics for an agenda tomorrow .
