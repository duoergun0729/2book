Subject: losses at kyrene - 5 / 31
lisa -
i ' m trying to figure out why two deals entered to cover losses at kyrene for the 31 st of may didn ' t make it into the preschedule sheet . i ' m looking for the following deals :
627022 - stsw buys epe
pv
hlh - 2 mw @ $ 0
comments : losses at kyrene
627025 - stsw buys epe
pv
hlh - 76 mw @ $ 170
comments : delivery at kyrene
these deals are pulling into the carp report , but are not shown in either the preschedule or real time el paso models . therefore , enpower is showing more volume and a higher total cost for the day than our model . can you give me a hint on this one ?
thanks ,
kate
