subject : real time sheet format
hi bill :
i work with neil bresnan in houston and i ' m responsible for entering the real - time deals into the database . i was hoping that whoever creates the real - time sheet that you send to us could just put in the delivery point instead of including both points in a spread deal . i think it would be easier for anyone entering the deals here to just have the delivery point . hope i have made my request clear , please let me know if i need to clarify this further .
thanks a lot ,
geiv
