how many times have you seen new issues explode but you couldn ' t get your hands on them ? we are alerting you to a special company with a unique business model that is set to explode in next 1 month - - this is your chance to get in at the very beginning !
this is also a chance to get in early , where usually only institutional investors get in , at the beginning . the average investor rarely gets the opportunity to get new issue shares at the beginning because brokers give them all to hedge funds and clients that do thousands of dollars of commission business with them , thereby leaving the small individual out in the cold !
this is exciting business in an exciting place and time . don ' t be the one to look back and say , i had the chance to invest , but passed .
