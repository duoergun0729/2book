a friend is one who knows us , but loves us anyway .
he was exhaled his great creator drew his spirit , as the sun the morning dew .
the right honorable gentlemen is indebted to his memory for his jokes and his imagination for his facts . all growth depends upon activity . there is no development physically or intellectually without effort , and effort means work . there is no instinct like that of the heart . memory moderates prosperity , decreases adversity , controls youth and delights old age . nothing retains less of desire in art , in science , than this will to industry , booty , possession . the man who removes a mountain begins by carrying away small stones .
we only love truly once . it is the first time and succeeding passions are less uncontrolled .
the ultimate sin of any performer is contempt for the audience . to become a thoroughly good man is the best prescription for keeping a sound mind and a sound body .
a part of kindness consists in loving people more than they deserve .
public sentiment is everything , without it nothing can fail , without it nothing can succeed .
you can tell the ideals of a nation by its advertisements . writing and travel broaden your ass if not your mind and i like to write standing up .
discipline is not a nasty word .
one must think like a hero to behave like a merely decent human being .
we are all in the gutter , but some of us are looking at the stars .
