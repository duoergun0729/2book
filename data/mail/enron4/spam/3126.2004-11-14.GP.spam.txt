see
with your own eyes . no joke here
although still technically in beta , the new
msn search debuted on november 11 , 2004 , after having for years relied on
licensed search technology from yahoo . earlier this year , the software giant
began building its own search algorithm and now boasts more than 5 billion pages
indexed and updated regularly - - a database roughly comparable to google ' s and
yahoo ' s . but it ' s not size that matters ; it ' s what a search engine does with the
many features associated with a good search engine , and microsoft has yet to
prove itself .
upside : the beta version of msn search offers
tighter integration with other microsoft properties , drawing results from
encarta and msn music . msn search catches up with other search engines by
offering neighborhood - specific searches and advanced search - querying
capabilities missing from previous iterations of msn search , such as restricting
results to a specific site domain , country , language , or even
popularity .
