hello !
yawo
you can lease the peace of mind you bought a mask , i put it on . you never thought to ask me if i wear it when you ' re gonea book is the only immortality .
his hilarity was like a scream from a crevasse .
eyes lie if you ever look into them for the character of the person . the best leaders . . . almost without exception and at every level , are master users of stories and symbols .
familiarity breeds contempt and children .
so live that you can look any man in the eye and tell him to go to hell . people are slow to believe that , which if believed would work them harm .
experience is a comb which nature gives to men when they are bald .
we pay when old for the excesses of youth .
there is a great man who makes every man feel small . but the real great man is the man who makes every man feel great .
if you have a dream , give it a chance to happen . all noble enthusiasms pass through a feverish stage , and grow wiser and more serene .
better to be ignorant of a matter than half know it .
it is with trifles and when he is off guard that a man best reveals his character .
that which we obtain too easily , we esteem too lightly . you can fail so very often . but you are not a failure until you give up . you talk too much , you laugh too loud , that ' s the price of love .
