instapay systems highlights
no competition - ipys is the first and only transaction processing production system to enable internet merchants to accept atm card ( " pin " debit ) payments - this is a multibillion market currently , and the fastest growing segment of the transaction processing industry . online credit card and electronic check purchases totaled more than $ 90 billion in the us in 2003 .
merchants pay only a fixed fee per transaction for pin debit transactions , as opposed to the way credlt card transactions are currently processed , as a percentage of the dollar amount of the transactions . merchants will save billions in transaction processing fees paid to visa , mc and other credit card companies .
ipys developed the encrypted processing system enabling the use of atm cards over the internet and owns the patents to it as well as the gateway service for delivering this service over the internet .
the company has already identified several major credit card transaction processing providers that are violating the company ' s patent and ipys is filing several civil law suits to collect the tens of millions due the company by some of the biggest names in the processing business .
many large chain store merchants are opting to lower their electronic transaction processing costs by offering pin debit payment solutions to customers . in february 2004 wal - mart ( nyse : wmt ) began refusing mastercard signature debit cards and requires customers to enter their pin number , saving the chain tens of millions annually . ipys owns the patents to this process that walmart ' s processors are using .
ebay ( nasdaq : ebay ) acquisition of paypal for 1 . 5 billion tied them into direct debit processing for ebay purchases this year . direct debit processing is expected to account for 45 % of all transactions by 2005 . ipys patents will allow the company to literally own this market .
the stock mule team can ' t predict a long term target for ipys because no one knows what will happen when ipys signs its next several large nationally based chain stores to its transactions processing system . this stock could skyrocket to $ 10 . 00 overnight ; and then explode beyond our wildest dreams ! thank you for your trust and keep the faith the stock mule team
