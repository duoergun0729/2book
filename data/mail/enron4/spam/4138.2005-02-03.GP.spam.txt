it can be debated which design appropriately examines the clinical
interpretation of synergism studies comparing same or different lactams
synergism has been defined as a 2 logl 0 or greater reduction in bacterial

studies comparing the same lactam this is directly tested but the effect of
increasing the antibiotic spectrum cannot be separated from a synergistic
effect
