Subject: in good faith
dear brother / sister
just to introduce myself , i am pastor john blake . by his grace , i ' m part
of the fellowship of the unashamed . i have stepped over the line . the
decision has been made - - i am a disciple of jesus christ . therefore , i
won ' t look back , let up , slow down , back away , or be still . my past is
redeemed , my present makes sense , and my future is secure . i am
finished and done with low living , sight walking , small planning , smooth
knees , colorless dreams , tamed visions , mundane talking , cheap living ,
and dwarfed goals .
my entire life has been dedicated to helping the poor , the needy , those
in suffering , those overlooked by good fortune , those who have nothing
else but the courage to move on and who struggle in a cruel and
unfriendly world , a world built on inequity and whatever your financial
need , please do not hesitate to let me know .
with god , all things are possible but do you know god ? well , you may not
know him , but he knows everything about you psalm 139 : 1 . he knows wha
you are going through and he is rady to work everything in your life for
good only if you receive the gift of his son jesus as your lord and
saviorl john 2 : 23 .
please send your complete address and telephone number so that i can
send some money to you to take care of your immediate need .
peace i leave with you ; my peace i give to you ; not as the world gives
do i give to you . do not let your heart be troubled , nor let it be
fearful . john 14 : 27 .
i am presently in netherlands for a business . i will
contact my friend who owes me some money to send the
money to you so that you will be able to take care of
your immediate financial need but i will need your
address and your telephone number
you can contact me on this email address johnblakeo 01 @ netscape . net
yours in his service ,
brother john blake
