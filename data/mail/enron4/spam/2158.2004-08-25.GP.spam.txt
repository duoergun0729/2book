refurbs save
cash ! why hesitate getting the best value by getting the
exact same equipment , with original manufacturers warranty at a much
lower price . money back guarantee , if you are not satisfied
- valid for 7 days
only .
q :
what
is considered factory refurbished ?
a : there are lots of
things that can label items factory refurbished . some are so
frivolous , its laughable . but because consumer laws prevent
manufacturers from selling anything considered factory refurbished
as " new " , the second consumer gets the best deal . here are a few
examples :
manufacturers /
distributors are not allowed to export outside their territory /
country .
to avoid
" disturbing " the dealer / reseller channel in different
countries , manufacturers and distributors cannot export the
product , as new and therefore label it as refurb and reduce the
warranty .
most major retail
superstores offer a 30 - day money back guarantee on their
products and there are those consumers that just simply take
advantage of that . these items are returned to the manufacturer ,
inspected and repackaged like new .
items where the
box or casing was damaged in shipment , which are returned to the
manufacturer .
the item was
returned to the manufacturer because of a slight defect . the
part that was defective was replaced by the manufacturer , tested
and then repackaged just like new .
the item was
returned because of a minor cosmetic blemish on the casing that
was corrected .
demonstration
units are also considered factory refurbished . these units are
inspected , tested and repackaged .
the box was simply
opened . thats it !
brand new
overstocked items are also labeled factory refurbished .
it is
impossible to know the history of each item , but for whatever reason
the unit gets labeled factory refurbished it is inspected
serviced by the manufacturer then tested and repackaged to meet
original product specifications . all merchandise is warranted by
the original manufacturer unless otherwise
specified .
