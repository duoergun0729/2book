for over 10 years . can you imagine the amount of spam i used to receive daily after 10
years of business ? let me tell you . it was overwhelming to say the least . in a short
amount of time was very difficult to operate my online business . my inboxes where filled
with advertisements for every product and get rich quick scheme out there .
since my email accounts were for business use and all of my customers knew me by them ,
it was imperative that i kept them . i was determined to stop my inboxes from getting
cluttered every day . i tried every method possible to keep my inboxes clean but it was
getting worse by the month . after spending hundreds of dollars on spam blockers and
countless hours i finally found the perfect solution . it is called email box filter .

emails i was getting everyday and have not missed one single important email . on top of
all that i have eliminated any email virus threat . here is a link where you can see all the
