the english language . have you ever wondered why foreigners have trouble with the english language ? . let ' s face it . english is a crazy language . there is no egg in the eggplant
no ham in the hamburger . and neither pine nor apple in the pineapple . english muffins were not invented in england . french fries were not invented in france . we sometimes take english for granted but if we examine its paradoxes we find that quicksand takes you down slowly , boxing rings are square . and a guinea pig is neither from guinea nor is it a pig . if writers write , how come fingers don ' t fing . if the plural of tooth is teeth . shouldn ' t the plural of phone booth be phone beeth , if the teacher taught , why didn ' t the preacher praught . if a vegetarian eats vegetables . what the does a humanitarian eat ? why do people recite at a play , yet play at a recital ? park on driveways and drive on parkways . you have to marvel at the unique lunacy . of a language where a house can burn up as it burns down . and in which you fill in a form by filling it out . and a bell is only heard once it goes ! english was invented by people , not computers , and it reflects the creativity of the human race ( which of course isn ' t a race at all ) that is why when the stars are out they are visible , but when the lights are out they are invisible , and why it is that when i wind up my watch it starts , but when i wind up this observation , it ends .
