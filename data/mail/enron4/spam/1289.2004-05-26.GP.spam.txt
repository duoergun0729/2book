many years ago , on my way from hong kong to new york , i passed a
week in san francisco . a long time had gone by since i had been in
that city , during which my ventures in the orient had prospered
beyond my hope ; i was rich and could afford to revisit my own
country to renew my friendship with such of the companions of
my youth as still lived and remembered me with the old
affection . chief of these , i hoped , was mohun dampier ,
an old schoolmate with whom i had held a desultory
correspondence which had long ceased , as is the way
of correspondence between men . you may have observed
that the indisposition to write a merely social letter
is in the ratio of the square of the distance between
you and your correspondent . it is a law . i remembered
dampier as a handsome , strong young fellow of scholarly
tastes , with an aversion to work and a marked
indifference to many of the things that the world
cares for , including wealth , of which , however ,
he had inherited enough to put him beyond the reach
of want . in his family , one of the oldest and most
aristocratic in the country , it was , i think , a matter
of pride that no member of it had ever been in trade nor
politics , nor suffered any kind of distinction . mohan was
a trifle sentimental , and had in him a singular
element of superstition , which led him to the study
of all manner of occult subjects , although his sane
mental health safeguarded him against fantastic and
perilous faiths . he made daring incursions into the realm
of the unreal without renouncing his residence in
the partly surveyed and charted region of what
we are pleased to call certitude . the night of
my visit to him was stormy . the californian winter
was on , and the incessant rain splashed in the
deserted streets , or , lifted by irregular gusts
of wind , was hurled against the houses with incredible
fury . with no small difficulty my cabman found the
right place , away out toward the ocean beach ,
in a sparsely populated suburb . the dwelling ,
a rather ugly one , apparently , stood in the
centre of its grounds , which as nearly as i could
make out in the gloom were destitute of either
flowers or grass . three or four trees , writhing
and moaning in the torment of the tempest , appeared
to be trying to escape from their dismal
environment and take the chance of finding
a better one out at sea . the house was a
two - story brick structure with a tower , a
story higher , at one corner . in a window
of that was the only visible light .
something in the appearance of the
place made me shudder , a performance
that may have been assisted by a rill
of rainwater down my back as i scuttled
to cover in the doorway . in answer to
my note apprising him of my wish to call ,
dampier had written , ' don ' t ring -
open the door and come up . ' i did
so . the staircase was dimly lighted
by a single gas - jet at the top of the
second flight . i managed to reach the
landing without disaster and entered by an
open door into the lighted square room of
the tower . dampier came forward in gown and
slippers to receive me , giving me the greeting
that i wished , and if i had held a thought
that it might more fitly have been accorded me
at the front door the first look at him dispelled
any sense of his inhospitality . he was
not the same . hardly past middle age , he
had gone grey and had acquired a pronounced
stoop . his figure was thin and angular , his face
deeply lined , his complexion dead - white ,
without a touch of colour . his eyes ,
unnaturally , glowed with a fire that was almost uncanny .
mental health safeguarded him against fantastic and
perilous faiths . he made daring incursions into the realm
of the unreal without renouncing his residence in
the partly surveyed and charted region of what
we are pleased to call certitude . the night of
my visit to him was stormy . the californian winter
was on , and the incessant rain splashed in the
