Subject: no more fad diets , loose it the right way , loose it forever
did you know that you could cut your food right down to 1000 calories and still gain weight ?
eat 1000 , burn only 800 and you will gain weight - even though you ' re constantly hungry .
on the other hand , you could eat say 3 , 000 calories and loose a lot of weight - if you burn 3 , 500
which has less to do with exercise and mostly has to do with your metabolism .
boost your metabolism effectively and loose those unwanted pounds .
do some moderate exercise while taking it and loose even more pounds naturally and rapidly .
everyone that has ever lost a lot of weight knows that this is the only prooven way to loose and
keep the pounds off .
just dieting or exersing is simply not enough if you have a slow matabolism due to your genes .
